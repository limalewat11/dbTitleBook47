After outlining the contours of 'pragmatic environmentalism', Carolan considers the pressures that exist where ecology and society collide, such as population growth and its associated increased demands for food and energy.

Taken together, they pose a formidable challenge to both classroom teachers and academics.... Rather than deny the inherent conflicts and tensions in the field, in Critical Multicultural Analysis of Children&#x2019;s Literature: Mirrors, Windows, and Doors, Maria Jos� Botelho and Masha Kabakow Rudman confront, deconstruct, and reconstruct these terrains by proposing a reframing of the field.... Surely all of us &#x2013; children, teachers, and academics &#x2013; can benefit from this more expansive understanding of what it means to read books." Sonia Nieto, From the Foreword</p> <p></p> <p>Critical multicultural analysis provides a philosophical shift for teaching literature, constructing curriculum, and taking up issues of diversity and social justice. It problematizes children&#x2019;s literature, offers a way of reading power, explores the complex web of sociopolitical relations, and deconstructs taken-for-granted assumptions about language, meaning, reading, and literature: it is literary study as sociopolitical change. </p> <p></p> <p>Bringing a critical lens to the study of multiculturalism in children&#x2019;s literature, this book prepares teachers, teacher educators, and researchers of children&#x2019;s literature to analyze the ideological dimensions of reading and studying literature. Each chapter includes recommendations for classroom application, classroom research, and further reading. Helpful end-of-book appendixes include a list of children&#x2019;s book awards, lists of publishers, diagrams of the power continuum and the theoretical framework of critical multicultural analysis, and lists of selected children&#x2019;s literature journals and online resources. </p></p><p><p><strong>Maria Jos� Botelho, Ed.D.,&nbsp;</strong>was a faculty member at the Ontario Institute of Studies in Education of the University of Toronto and is currently Assistant Professor of Literacy Education in the Language, Literacy, and Culture Concentration of School of Education at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. </p> <p><strong>Masha Kabakow Rudman, Ed.D.,&nbsp;</strong>is Professor of Children&#x2019;s Literature and Multicultural Education in the Language, Literacy, and Culture Concentration of School of Education at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. </p><p>"This book is particularly useful for teachers, teacher educators, and researchers interested in designing curriculum for reading children&#x2019;s literature with a sociopolitical context in mind....By thoughtfully integrating both classroom practice and theory across the book, Botelho and Rudman equip readers with valuable reading strategies to "guide children in reading dominant discourses of race, class, and gender and identify how ideology is rendered in the materials they read" (p. 94)."--<strong>Language Arts</strong></p></p><h2>Jude the Obscure: Introduction by J. Hillis Miller (Everyman&#39;s Library Classics Series)</h2><p><p>Jude's story -- his futile desire to better himself through education, his failed marriage and doomed love for the free-spirited Sue Bridehead -- shows with heartbreaking clarity the devastating effects of prejudice and oppression upon innocent minds, and forms a passionate plea for tolerance.<br><br>Because of its frank treatment of human sexuality and its unflinching fatalism, <i>Jude the Obscure</i> aroused such a storm of controversy upon its publication in 1895 that, partly in response, Thomas Hardy abandoned the art of novel-writing altogether and devoted the rest of his life to poetry. Though we have come a long way in our social attitudes in the ensuing century, nothing about Hardy's masterpiece has lost its power to shock us and disturb our dreams.</p></p><p>Thomas Hardy&#39;s last novel charts the life of Jude Fawley from his parochial childhood to his death in the collegiate city of Christminster, the centre of his intellectual dreams and their failure. Initially published as a much-abridged serial, the text first appeared in its full and present form in 1895.In 1895 Hardy's final novel, the great tale of <i>Jude The Obscure</i>, sent shockwaves of indignation rolling across Victorian England. Hardy had dared to write frankly about sexuality and to indict the institutions of marriage, education, and religion. But he had, in fact, created a deeply moral work. The stonemason Jude Fawley is a dreamer; his is a tragedy of unfulfilled aims. With his tantalizing cousin Sue Bridehead, the last and most extraordinary of Hardy's heroines, Jude takes on the world--and discovers, tragically, its brutal indifference. The most powerful expression of Hardy's philosophy, and a profound exploration of man's essential loneliness, <i>Jude The Obscure</i> is a great and beautiful book. "His style touches sublimity."--T.S. Eliot</p><h2>Medieval Warfare: A History</h2><p>The medieval period was a singular epoch in military history--an age profoundly influenced by martial ideals, whose very structure of society was organized for war, and whose leaders were by necessity warriors. Now, the richly illustrated <em>Medieval Warfare</em> illuminates this era, examining over seven hundred years of European conflict, from the time of Charlemagne to the end of the middle ages (1500). Twelve scholars examine medieval warfare in two sections. The first section explores the experience of war chronologically, with essays on the Viking age, on the wars and expansion of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, on the Crusades, and on the great Hundred Years War between England and France. The second section traces developments in the art of warfare: fortification and siege craft, the role of armored cavalrymen, the use of mercenary forces, the birth of gunpowder artillery, and the new skills in navigation and shipbuilding.<br></p><p><br><strong>Maurice Keen</strong> is Tutor in Medieval History, and Fellow of Balliol College, Oxford University. He lives in the United Kingdom.<br>A comprehensive anthology of essays by highly placed British academics (joined by one from West Point) that survey military development in the Middle Ages. Arguing in his introduction that war is central to the narrative political story of the middle ages, Keen (History/Oxford; Chivalry, 1984) has assembled a series of 12 crisply topical essays that consider how warfare became increasingly organized, mechanized, and militarized between 900 and 1500. Keen and his fellow authors make clear that this acceleration of war-making was primarily defensive, as the fledgling European societies were regularly besieged by invaders like the Magyars and Vikings. In an attention-getting early chapter, H.B. Clark observes that the Vikings derived much of their power from their simultaneously elusive and brutal nature (they combined sophisticated tactics of organized raiding with a knack of attracting poetic tributes to their violence). John Gillinghams An Age of Expansion shows how this defensive pattern underlies the warfare over Saxony and the later colonial wars in Spain, Scotland, and Ireland. And Peter Edburys Warfare in the Latin East examines the defensive motivations of the European campaigns against Muslims ranging from Eastern Europe to Jerusalem, campaigns we remember as the Crusades. Later chapters deal with more tactical matters, exploring how proprietary medieval notions, particularly chivalry, fared in the context of warfares increasing standardization, and covering the developing range of fortifications, siege tactics, and arms and armor. Following Christopher Allmands unusual survey of War and the Non-Combatant, Keen closes with his own review of the emergence of cannon, gunpowder, and permanent armies as the ultimate developments of medieval militarism. A scrupulously prepared survey that will be invaluable to students and accessible to committed lay readers. (100 b&amp;w illus.)

In addition to the Pulitzer Prize he was awarded for his reviews in <em>The Washington Post</em>, he picked up an Edgar from the Mystery Writers of America for his most recent book, <em>On Conan Doyle</em>. <p>Dirda's latest volume collects fifty of his witty and wide-ranging reflections on literary journalism, book collecting, and the writers he loves. Reaching from the classics to the post-moderns, his allusions dance from Samuel Johnson, Ralph Waldo Emerson and M. F. K. Fisher to Marilynne Robinson, Hunter S. Thompson, and David Foster Wallace. Dirda's topics are equally diverse: literary pets, the lost art of cursive writing, book inscriptions, the pleasures of science fiction conventions, author photographs, novelists in old age, Oberlin College, a year in Marseille, writer's block, and much more, not to overlook a few rants about Washington life and American culture. As admirers of his earlier books will expect, there are annotated lists galore&#x2015;of perfect book titles, great adventure novels, favorite words, essential books about books, and beloved children's classics, as well as a revealing peek at the titles Michael keeps on his own nightstand.</p> Funny and erudite, occasionally poignant or angry, <em>Browsings</em> is a celebration of the reading life, a fan's notes, and the perfect gift for any booklover.</p><p>Michael Dirda is a Pulitzer Prize-winning critic and longtime book columnist for The Washington Post. He was once chosen by Washingtonian Magazine as one of the twenty-five smartest people in our nation&#x2019;s capital (but, as Michael says, you have to consider the competition). He also writes regularly for the Times Literary Supplement;the New York Review of Books and other literary journals. His previous publications include the memoir An Open Book, four collections of essays&#x2015;Readings, Bound to Please, Book by Book, and Classics for Pleasure&#x2015;and On Conan Doyle, for which he won an Edgar Award. A lifelong Sherlock Holmes and Conan Doyle fan, he was inducted into The Baker Street Irregulars in 2002. He lives in Silver Spring, Maryland.&#x201c;This joy-filled, reflective collection makes perfect bedside reading.&nbsp;Literate but never snobby, this collection of essays surely will&nbsp;entertain and enlighten book lovers of all stripes.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Booklist</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>Browsings</em> is as much about living with books, about serendipitous discovery, as about the boundless pleasures of reading. Dirda's comradely essays are unfailingly informative and amusing, punctuated with poignant asides on the aging artist and paeans to great literary scholars. His almost single-minded passion, the exhilaration of a life in literature, glows on every page.&nbsp;&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews (starred review)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Beyond bibliophilism, this is a work about how reading stories builds relationships&#x2015;between readers and writers and between readers and readers&#x2015;and how these relationships change and shape one&#x2019;s life. Dirda&#x2019;s exuberance is infectious, and the book is hard to put down. Clearly this author recognizes that the most important quality of a book is the pleasure it gives.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Library Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A rambunctious personality wanders the aisles of rare-book stores; musing about language, aging and traffic; and catching up with fellow aficionados of the weird and the obscure. The innumerable forgotten books he catalogs are captivating.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The New York Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A set of appealingly conversational meditations on the life of the mind. The author&#x2019;s personality is so vivid and immediate that a readerly rapport is established almost instantly. The hallmarks of the Dirdanian sensibility includes a wry, slightly avuncular tone that wears its erudition slightly, a pronounced interest in genre fiction, and a sturdy sort of common-sense approach to critical theory, all with a light dusting of loveable curmudgeon and a sprinkle of raffish boulevardier. Cheerfully eccentric, Dirda eschews the lofty pronouncement of Olympian judgment, preferring instead a hale and friendly exploration of shared enthusiasm.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Washington Post</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Dirda's enthusiasm is manifest, and his knowledge is often impressive. Dirda's first-person voice and confessional zeal make him an easy author to like.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Times Literary Supplement</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Michael Dirda is one of the great book reviewers of our age. It is not merely that his writing is so lucid and intelligent or that his taste is so inclusive but discerning. The key to his particular magic is that he is always alert to the complex pleasures that animate literature. His engaging essays are those of a restless, omnivorous reader and a true bookman.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Dana Gioia, poet and former chair of the National Endowment for the Arts</strong><br><br>&#x201c;If we were all to write about reading as Dirda does, if we taught children to write from joy rather than to form arguments, then the world would have many more serious readers and far better books.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Bookforum</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Elegantly written musings about calligraphy, writer&#x2019;s block, genre conferences, the books on a given critic&#x2019;s nightstand, with the odd personal reminiscence thrown in.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Los Angele Review of Books</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The 52 pieces collected in <em>Browsings</em> shine with Dirda's passion for books, both as a reader and a collector, and are certain to delight any bibliophile. They reveal the mind of a critic with an astonishing breadth of literary knowledge and a talent for sharing that learning in accessible, often humorous, prose.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Shelf Awareness</em></strong></p><h2>Steps to Writing Well with Additional Readings, 2016 MLA Update and 2019 APA Updates</h2><p>Writing well is just a step away!

Author Jean Mav�ric provides botanical and medicinal classifications of over 600 plant species along with an in-depth study of their astral natures, elemental qualities, and planetary and zodiacal signatures as well as practical advice on the appropriate times to harvest plants and administer herbal remedies and quintessences. <br><br>Reviewing the general principles and procedures of premodern chemistry, Mav�ric then explores the secret doctrines and operations of the spagyric art. He offers a large collection of recipes for spagyric herbal preparations adapted from celebrated spagyrists such as Paracelsus, Pseudo-Lull, Philipp Ulstad, Jan Baptist van Helmont, Oswald Croll, and Nicaise Le F�vre, providing detailed step-by-step instructions for a veritable pharmacopeia of spagyric extracts, tinctures, elixirs, liquors, oils, unguents, salts, <i>aquae vitae</i>, and quintessences. Mav�ric also shares his intricate theory of astral medicine and advocates a seasonal &#x201c;Hermetic diet&#x201d; designed to keep the humors of the body in equilibrium and prevent the onset of illness. In the final section of the book, Mav�ric focuses on the more advanced methods and techniques of Paracelsus, Helmont, and George Starkey, unraveling the mysteries of manufacturing alkalis, alkahests, and menstrua and divulging his own secret formula for a universal <i>circulatum</i>. <br><br>Available now for the first time in English, this occult classic unveils the art of extracting spagyric essences to a modern audience while also bringing the science of herbal medicine back to its Hermetic roots.</p><p>Little is known about the life of the writer behind the pseudonym Jean Mav�ric except that he was a prominent figure in occult and alchemical circles in Paris in the early twentieth century. He was affiliated with Papus&#x2019;s <i>�cole herm�tique</i>, where he taught courses in Hermetic philosophy and astrology, and was also an active member of the <i>Soci�t� alchimique de France</i>, a group of practicing occultists devoted to the study and revival of alchemy. Jean Mav�ric also wrote under the pseudonyms &#x201c;Jean B�lus&#x201d; and &#x201c;Jean Petit,&#x201d; the latter of which appears to corroborate occult bibliographer Albert Louis Caillet&#x2019;s assertion that &#x201c;Jean Mav�ric&#x201d; was the nom de plume of Maurice Petitjean.</p><h2>Designing Camelot: The Kennedy White House Restoration</h2><p>Offers a room-by-room tour of the restoration</p><p>Designing Camelot is the first book to document the restoration of the White House by Jacqueline Kennedy and her advisors--the most extensive to date. Under the watchful eye of the Fine Arts Committee for the White House, chaired by famed antiquarian Henry Francis du Pont and, unbeknownst to the American public, French interior designer Stephane Boudin and his firm Jansen, the White House became a model for historic houses all over America. Through rich anecdotes and a stunning collection of four-color and black and white photographs, Designing Camelot illustrates the rich interiors of the White House, while at the same time exploring the restoration as an extension of the Kennedy/Camelot legacy."Perhaps one of the finest commentaries on American decorative arts ever published." William Seale White House Historian Designing Camelot The Kennedy White House Restoration James A. Abbott � Elaine M. Rice "From the moment President John F. Kennedy took the oath of office, his administration was characterized as having style," write authors James Abbott and Elaine Rice in their exquisite new book Designing Camelot. Nowhere was the "Kennedy style" more evident than in the rooms in which the young President and his wife Jacqueline lived and worked between 1961 and 1963, as America witnessed the transformation of its premier residence from "home of the President" to "house-museum." Designing Camelot is the first book to document the restoration of the White House by Jacqueline Kennedy and her advisors&#x2014;the most significant and extensive to date. Under the watchful eye of the Fine Arts Committee for the White House, chaired by famed antiquarian Henry Francis du Pont and, unbeknownst to the American public, French interior designer St�phane Boudin and his firm Jansen, the White House became a model for historic houses all over America. Many of the country&#x2019;s governors&#x2019; mansions were renovated as state First Ladies strove to emulate the efforts of a sophisticated Jacqueline Kennedy. Through rich anecdotes and a stunning collection of four-color and black and white photographs, Designing Camelot illustrates the rich interiors of the White House, while at the same time exploring the restoration as an extension of the Kennedy/Camelot legacy. Individual chapters examine the White House room by room inviting a look at not only familiar public places like the Oval Office and West Wing, but the Kennedys&#x2019; private quarters as well. Kennedy enthusiasts, interior designers, architects, collectors, history buffs, preservationists, museum professionals, and White House watchers alike will enjoy this intimate look at the taste and style of Jacqueline Kennedy, the most watched First Lady of America, and the relationship between an extraordinary client and her designers. Far beyond the mere selection of furniture and fabrics, the renovation of the White House reflected the desire of the Kennedys&#x2014;Jacqueline Kennedy in particular&#x2014;to associate themselves with a grand historical past, and their efforts to enhance the entire atmosphere surrounding the Presidency. Designing Camelot captures this incredible era as never before, and offers a unique insight into the collective Kennedy mind and personality.</p><h2>Organic Chemistry I For Dummies (For Dummies Series)</h2><p><p><b><i>Organic Chemistry I For Dummies, 2 Edition (9781118828076) is now being published as Organic Chemistry I For Dummies, 2 Edition (9781119293378).

In fact, many of the thirteen states saw fierce debate over the document, and ratification was by no means certain. Virginia, the largest and most influential state, approved the Constitution by the barest of margins, and only after an epic political battle between James Madison and Patrick Henry. Now Richard Labunski offers a dramatic account of a time when the entire American experiment hung in the balance, only to be saved by the most unlikely of heroes--the diminutive and exceedingly shy Madison. <br> Here is a vividly written account of not one but several major political struggles which changed the course of American history. Labunski takes us inside the sweltering converted theater in Richmond, where for three grueling weeks, the soft-spoken Madison and the charismatic Patrick Henry fought over whether Virginia should ratify the Constitution. The stakes were enormous. If Virginia voted no, George Washington could not become president, New York might follow suit and reject the Constitution, and the young nation would be thrust into political chaos. But Madison won the day by a handful of votes, mollifying Anti-Federalist fears by promising to add a bill of rights to the Constitution. To do this, Madison would have to win a seat in the First Congress. Labunski shows how the vengeful Henry prevented Madison's appointment to the Senate and then used his political power to ensure that Madison would run against his good friend, Revolutionary War hero James Monroe, in a House district teeming with political enemies. Overcoming great odds, Madison won by a few hundred votes, allowing him to attend the First Congress and sponsor the Bill of Rights. <br> Packed with colorful details about life in early America, this compelling and important narrative is the first serious book about Madison written in many years. It will return this under-appreciated patriot to his rightful place among the Founding Fathers and shed new light on a key turning point in our nation's history.<br></p><p><br><strong>Richard Labunski</strong> is a professor in the School of Journalism and Telecommunications at the University of Kentucky. The author of four other books, he previously taught at the University of Washington and Penn State and worked for ten years in radio and television news.<br>Shy, sickly, unprepossessing, and very young at the time, future President James Madison played a crucial role in shaping the American Constitution, which he advocated, and framing the Bill of Rights, which he initially opposed. This book exhaustively details the ideas, politics, and personalities that led to the adoption of the first 10 amendments and how Madison influenced them. The author apparently intends his 336 fact-filled pages for those wishing to drench themselves in the subject. With his clarion newscaster's voice, reliable Richard Poe protects the 11-plus-hour exegesis from dryness. His excellent phrasing provides additional clarity to an already-accessible text.

Leading public health authorities now predict as inevitable a pandemic of influenza, triggered by bird flu and expected to lead to millions of deaths around the globe.<br><br> The influenza virus has existed for millions of years as an innocuous intestinal virus of wild ducks. What turned a harmless waterborne duck virus into a killer? In <strong>Bird Flu</strong>, Dr. Michael Greger traces the human role in the evolution of this virus, whose humble beginnings belie its transformation into a killer mutant strain with the potential to become as ferocious as Ebola and as contagious as the common cold. In the face of the coming pandemic, Dr. Greger reveals what we can do to protect our families and what human society to can do to reduce the likelihood of such catastrophes in the future.<br><br> Amid the growing panic surrounding this issue, Dr. Greger takes a sobering look at a deadly cycle and offers a solution to ending it.</p><p><b>Here's what people are saying about <i>Bird Flu:</i></b><p> "The book reads like a detective novel, but its value will be equipping readers to protect themselves from the flu....

Although the Wizard Howl (this time in the guise of an irritating, lisping little boy); his feisty wife, Sophie; and Calcifer the fire demon play important roles, the story centers on Charmain, a bookish teen. When Charmain&#x2019;s great-uncle William, the king&#x2019;s Royal Wizard, falls deathly ill and is taken in by elves for a cure, Charmain is sent to look after William&#x2019;s house, which is, indeed, a house of many ways and rooms and magic within. She begins reading William&#x2019;s books and discovers that she has inherited some of his gifts. Enriching this elaborate and satisfying comic fantasy are some delicious characters, including a&nbsp;little dog named Waif, who seems to be guarding Charmain; young Peter, who arrives to become the wizard&#x2019;s apprentice; the elderly king and his mysteriously vanishing treasury; the evil heir-apparent; and a fearsome creature called a&nbsp;lubbock. Long-standing devotees of this richly textured world, as well as new fans (who may have first encountered&nbsp;it through the 2005 animated film of Howl&#x2019;s Moving Castle), will find that their third visit&nbsp;fulfills every expectation.

The definition, nature, and treatment of CVI are the focus of great concern and widespread debate, and this complex condition poses challenges to professionals and families seeking to support the growth and development of visually impaired children. On the basis of more than 30 years&#39; experience in working with hundreds of children of all ages with CVI, Christine Roman-Lantzy has developed a set of unique assessment tools and systematic, targeted principles whose use has helped children learn to use their vision more effectively. This one-of-a-kind resource provides readers with both a conceptual framework with which to understand working with CVI and concrete strategies to apply directly in their work.</p><p></p><h2>Japanese Woodblock Print Workshop: A Modern Guide to the Ancient Art of Mokuhanga</h2><p><b>An inspirational how-to course on Japanese woodblock printing's history and techniques, with guidance on materials and studio practices, step-by-step demonstrations, and examples of finished works by modern masters of the medium as well as historic pieces.<br>&nbsp;</b> <br>A Modern Guide to the Ancient Art of mokuhanga<br><br> An increasingly popular yet age-old art form, Japanese woodblock printing (<i>mokuhanga</i>) is embraced for its non-toxic character, use of handmade materials, and easy integration with other printmaking techniques. In this comprehensive guide, artist and printmaker April Vollmer&#x2014;one of the best known <i>mokuhanga</i> practitioners and instructors in the West&#x2014;combines her deep knowledge of this historic printmaking practice with expert step-by-step instruction, guidance on materials and studio practices, and a diverse collection of prints by leading contemporary artists. At once practical and inspirational, this handbook is as useful to serious printmakers and artists as it is to creative people drawn <br> to Japanese history and aesthetics.</p><p>APRIL VOLLMER is a New York artist who studied <i>mokuhanga</i> after receiving her Master of Fine Arts in printmaking at Hunter College. Her work has been shown widely and she teaches regularly at the Lower East Side Printshop. She has participated in many residencies, including the Nagasawa Art Park in Japan; and was on the board of the first and second International Mokuhanga Conferences.<b>The Purpose of this Book<br></b><br> This book was conceived as an introduction to the basics of mokuhanga for creative artists outside Japan. While it includes some information about professional practice in Japan, it is written with the belief that this flexible technique can be adapted for use by individual artist-printmakers. With experience, artists can develop an approach to woodblock printing that reflects their particular situation, technical ability, and available resources.<br><br> In addition to the step-by-step chapter that outlines how a print is made, the book includes a chapter on tools and materials, and a chapter on <i>washi</i>, handmade Japanese paper. The materials used to produce mokuhanga were developed in Japan during the country&#x2019;s evolution from a feudal agrarian culture with rice as the medium of exchange into an urban money-based culture. An understanding of the special materials developed during that time allows artists to use them most effectively. The manufacture of paper and sumi ink for calligraphy, introduced from China and Korea, set the stage for the production of woodblock multiples using the same materials. The especially sharp cutting tools used for woodblock are forged from the same kind of bonded steel used in samurai swords and are sharpened on the same kind of water stones. These materials provided the foundation for the rise of mokuhanga during the Edo period.&nbsp;<br><br> The refined techniques of mokuhanga, developed by experts in specialized workshops, give the craft a complexity that takes time to master. Professional printers created sophisticated methods that took them many years of practice to perfect in order to print a wide variety of books, prints, and advertisements. Creative artists pursuing distinctly different goals can learn many technical details about carving and printing from these professionals that will help them make prints in their own studios.&nbsp;<br><br> Making mokuhanga prints since the mid-nineties, I developed the skills I needed to print my own images, working as simply as possible to make creative rather than reproductive artwork. When I began doing research for this book, I looked beyond my own practice to find additional information about the working methods of professional Japanese printers. My respect for these specialists has only increased over time, and yet I believe there is an important place for artists who develop an individual way of working that reflects their aims as creative printmakers. I remain convinced that contemporary artists can learn the basic technique well enough to use mokuhanga for their own work. I have tried to convey some of the flavor of the impressive work of professionals, but this book focuses on making the technique accessible. Maintaining sensitivity to materials is the one essential key to using this technique successfully.&nbsp;<br><br> In my research, I was surprised again and again at the intimacy with the natural world evidenced in the approach to materials used in mokuhanga. The craftsmen of Japan paid careful attention to working methods, and also to the plants and animals around them. Often I had to check the binomial names for plants that were used for color, for paper, and for many other functions in the world of woodblock. Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus (1707&#x2013;1778) developed scientific taxonomy during the same period that ukiyo-e prints evolved. His binomial nomenclature is the foundation for a systematic understanding of the natural world. The Japanese use of materials that evolved during the same time reflects a similarly systematic impulse.&nbsp;<br><br> A note about language use: I have used the English convention for Japanese proper names, with family name last, to be consistent with the many Western names in the text. A variety of translations for Japanese terms exist, and I have tried to use the most common spelling. For example, the word &#x201c;mokuhanga,&#x201d; while composed of three characters, is most commonly used as a single word. Where two versions exist, I have opted for a hyphenated use so that the structure of a compound name is most clear; for example, the registration chisel is <i>kento-nomi</i>. I have avoided pluralizing Japanese terms. Sizes of prints are all approximate.</p><h2>The Penguin Complete Father Brown (Father Brown Mystery)</h2><p>12 stories that find Chesterton&#39;s amateur detective resolving the strangest of situations - from Tuscany to Devon, from Fulham to Chicago.</p><p><b>G.K.

This book, essentially an &#x201c;anarchist history,&#x201d; is the first-ever examination of the huge literature on state-making whose author evaluates why people would deliberately and reactively remain stateless. Among the strategies employed by the people of Zomia to remain stateless are physical dispersion in rugged terrain; agricultural practices that enhance mobility; pliable ethnic identities; devotion to prophetic, millenarian leaders; and maintenance of a largely oral culture that allows them to reinvent their histories and genealogies as they move between and around states.</p><p>In accessible language, James Scott, recognized worldwide as an eminent authority in Southeast Asian, peasant, and agrarian studies, tells the story of the peoples of Zomia and their unlikely odyssey in search of self-determination. He redefines our views on Asian politics, history, demographics, and even our fundamental ideas about what constitutes civilization, and challenges us with a radically different approach to history that presents events from the perspective of stateless peoples and redefines state-making as a form of &#x201c;internal colonialism.&#x201d; This new perspective requires a radical reevaluation of the civilizational narratives of the lowland states. Scott&#x2019;s work on Zomia represents a new way to think of area studies that will be applicable to other runaway, fugitive, and marooned communities, be they Gypsies, Cossacks, tribes fleeing slave raiders, Marsh Arabs, or San-Bushmen.</p></p><p>The author of several books including <i>Seeing Like a State</i>, <b>James C. Scott</b> is Sterling Professor of Political Science, professor of anthropology, and codirector of the Agrarian Studies Program, Yale University, and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.&#x201c;James Scott has produced here perhaps his most masterful work to date. It is deeply learned, creative and compassionate. Few scholars possess a keener capacity to recognize the agency of peoples without history and in entirely unexpected places, practices and forms. Indeed, it leads him ever closer to the anarchist ideal that it is possible for humans not only to escape the state, but the very state form itself.&#x201d;&#x2014;Prasenjit Duara, National University of Singapore<br> (Prasenjit Duara)<br><br> &#x201c;A brilliant study rich with humanity and cultural insights, this book will change the way readers think about human history&#x2014;and about themselves. It is one of the most fascinating and provocative works in social history and political theory I, for one, have ever read.&#x201d;&#x2014;Robert W. Hefner, Boston University<br><br> (Robert W. Hefner)<br><br>"Underscores key, but often overlooked, variables that tell us a great deal about why states rise and expand as well as decline and collapse. There are no books that currently cover these themes in this depth and breadth, with such conceptual clarity, originality, and imagination.

Villainy, schemes, and deceit threatens to darken the brilliant humor and sparkling wordplay--but the hilarious counterplot of a warring couple, Beatrice and Benedick, steals the scene as the two are finally tricked into admitting their love for each other in Shakespeare&#39;s superb comedy of manners.</p><h2>The Real American Dream: A Meditation on Hope</h2><p><p>Since we discovered that, in Tocqueville's words, "the incomplete joys of this world will never satisfy the heart," how have we Americans made do? In <i>The Real American Dream</i> one of the nation's premier literary scholars searches out the symbols and stories by which Americans have reached for something beyond worldly desire. A spiritual history ranging from the first English settlements to the present day, the book is also a lively, deeply learned meditation on hope.</p><p>Andrew Delbanco tells of the stringent God of Protestant Christianity, who exerted immense force over the language, institutions, and customs of the culture for nearly 200 years. He describes the falling away of this God and the rise of the idea of a sacred nation-state. And, finally, he speaks of our own moment, when symbols of nationalism are in decline, leaving us with nothing to satisfy the longing for transcendence once sustained by God and nation. </p><p>From the Christian story that expressed the earliest Puritan yearnings to New Age spirituality, apocalyptic environmentalism, and the multicultural search for ancestral roots that divert our own, <i>The Real American Dream</i> evokes the tidal rhythm of American history. It shows how Americans have organized their days and ordered their lives--and ultimately created a culture--to make sense of the pain, desire, pleasure, and fear that are the stuff of human experience. In a time of cultural crisis, when the old stories seem to be faltering, this book offers a lesson in the painstaking remaking of the American dream.</p></p><p><i>The Real American Dream: A Meditation on Hope</i> is a jewel of a book by Andrew Delbanco. It distills the spiritual history of the United States into three short chapters: "God," "Nation," and "Self." Delbanco writes that the history of hope in America is a history "of diminution." In Puritan New England, "the self expanded toward (and was sometimes overwhelmed by) the vastness of God." Between the rise of Constitutional Democracy and the post-World War II Great Society, citizens' hopes "remained implicated in a national ideal lesser than God but larger and more enduring than any individual citizen." And today, Delbanco believes, "hope has narrowed to the vanishing point of the self alone." But <i>The Real American Dream</i> is still cautiously optimistic in its final analysis of our self-centered society. "[T]he sense of fairness and decency for which the American people are regularly complimented by their politicians is actually real and abiding. Against all odds, the live issues of our day are still sometimes debated with dignity." <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>Andrew Delbanco is the Mendelson Family Chair of American Studies and Julian Clarence Levi Professor in the Humanities at Columbia University.</p><h2>The Pediatrician&#39;s Guide to Feeding Babies and Toddlers: Practical Answers To Your Questions on Nutrition, Starting Solids, Allergies, Picky Eating, and More (For Parents, By Parents)</h2><p><b>A comprehensive manual for feeding babies and toddlers during the crucial first years of life, written by a team of medical experts who are also parents.<br></b><br>All Your Questions about Feeding, Answered.<br><br> The choices of when, how, and what to feed your baby can be overwhelming.

Anthony is interested in nutrition, especially in the care of children with difficulty gaining weight, feeding issues, and celiac disease.<b>Introduction</b><br> <i>The Pediatrician&#x2019;s</i> <i>Guide to Feeding Babies &amp; Toddlers</i> combines the expertise of a group of pediatricians, a dietitian, a lactation consultant, and two chefs. More importantly, we are also parents to a total of thirteen children. Most of us met during our medical training and cultivated strong friendships during our many long days and nights working together in a hospital. After completing our training over a decade ago, we felt that we were prepared to practice medicine. We couldn&#x2019;t imagine, however, how much our careers would be enhanced by our roles as parents. When Dina&#x2019;s daughters, Julia and Evelyn, were born just twenty-one months apart, Dina realized she didn&#x2019;t really know how a mother was feeling until she was a mother herself. As we were writing this book, Anthony was learning the ins and outs of fatherhood as he cared for his newborn son, Sebastian. Persephone was busy chasing after her twin toddler boys, Sean and Aaron. Janet bonded with her newborn daughter, Annie, and toddler son, Sid. Liza was busy helping her daughters, Emilia and Anna, with their homework and coordinating after-school activities; Susan was going on college tours with her son, Caleb; Alison developed recipes while taking care of her newborn son, Azriel; and Dini cooked alongside her little girl, Andi, while taking care of her newborn daughter, Jolie. Caring for our own children has helped us to understand the fears, anxieties, and questions of parents on a deeper level.<br><br> Over the years, we have discussed how often parents would ask the same questions about feeding their children. We found that parents did not know where to turn for guidance and became frustrated with trying to find the right information on their own. We also know that Google-searching (yes, we all do this, often bleary-eyed in the middle of the night!) can lead to additional anxiety and confusion.<br><br> We believe that feeding should be fun, stress-free, and family-oriented quality time. We created this book as a resource to provide easy access to common feeding questions from the minute an infant is born through the toddler years.&nbsp;<br><br> Dina, a general pediatrician, and Anthony, a pediatric gastroenterologist, who are the lead authors, assembled a team that includes a pediatric allergist, a developmental-behavioral pediatrician, a pediatric dietitian, and a lactation consultant, along with two family chefs to help answer common feeding and nutrition questions. This book was also reviewed for completeness and accuracy by an additional board-certified general pediatrician. The goal is to present the most current evidence-based information in an easy-to-read question-and-answer format. We understand the reality of parenthood and use this knowledge, along with our medical acumen, to develop practical approaches to the feeding and care of infants and toddlers. We want the best beginnings for the children we take care of, for our own children, and for your children.<br><br> <b>How to Use This Book</b><br> We have divided the book into five age groups from the newborn period to the early toddler years. Every section contains expected developmental milestones, basic nutritional guidelines, expected growth, common medical concerns, and ends with examples of developmentally appropriate recipes that contain tips to alleviate potential medical issues encountered at that stage.&nbsp;<br><br> In chapter 1, we discuss infants from birth to 3 months of life and end with healthy recipes for breastfeeding moms and hungry caregivers. In chapter 2, the 4 to 6 months group, we discuss the new challenge of how best to feed a baby solid foods and answer questions that commonly come up at this early stage of infant feeding. In chapters 3 and 4, we discuss the 7 to 8 month and 9 to 12 month age groups, respectively. As your child increases intake of solid foods, we will address common questions such as balancing solid food and milk intake, how to transition to finger foods, and choking hazards. We will discuss topics such as celiac disease, failure to thrive, iron deficiency anemia, and diarrhea. In chapter 5, we focus on the early toddler years, guiding parents on how to deal with picky eaters and providing healthy choices as children enter the school years. We end with chapter 6, which discusses the most common medical concerns in more detail and includes additional references and resources.&nbsp;<br><br> We designed this book not only to be a reference, but also a reassuring guide through the stage that your baby is in or about to go through. You can, therefore, use this book in multiple ways&#x2014;by quickly finding out the answer to a current concern, by reading the section that your baby is in now or about to be in, by reading the entire book and then referring back to particular sections later as you need them, or by referencing chapter 6 to find out more details about a specific medical concern.&nbsp;<br><br> We look forward to sharing our knowledge about infant and toddler nutrition, learned from our many collective years of caring for children in the medical field, combined with our practical experiences as parents ourselves. Raising a child provides you with some of the most extraordinary times in your life, but as we know, it can also be overwhelming. We hope to ease some of the stress of this journey by providing you with information you can trust and valuable insights into the world of childhood nutrition, so you can spend less time searching for answers and more time enjoying these fleeting moments.</p><h2>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn: and Related Readings (Literature Connections)</h2><p>A textbook reader for young adults features Mark Twain&#39;s &#34;The adventures of Huckleberry Finn,&#34; plus short stories, poems, and essays designed to build reading comprehension.</p><p></p><h2>The Human Body (An Illustrated Guide to Its Structure, Function, and Disorders)</h2><p>Filled with facts about every system and component and valuable information about problems, diagnostic techniques, treatments, and surgical procedures, a unique visual approach to understanding the human body emphasizes the ways individual parts of the body work together.</p><p>It&#39;s big, it&#39;s colorful, and it&#39;s got everything from your gallbladder and heart to your muscles, bones, blood and brain.

In affectionately told and poignant anecdotes, these sisters gets their due, in a reverent celebration of "their power, their strength, their pain, their ways, and their better days." <i>--Paul Hughes</i>Throughout history, African American women have tapped hidden sources of strength and inspiration to conquer impossible odds.

Born into a Jewish family in Germany at the beginning of the century, Arendt studied under Martin Heidegger and Karl Jaspers. She later fled the Nazi terror and established herself as a preeminent political and philosophical writer at New York's famed New School for Social Research.<br><br><i>The Portable Hannah Arendt</i>, the first comprehensive volume of her writings, includes generous selections from her masterworks: <i>The Origins of Totalitarianism</i>, <i>The Human Condition</i>, and her controversial <i>Eichmann in Jerusalem</i>. Also featured is a selection of Arendt's letters to other formative thinkers of the century, including Jaspers and Mary McCarthy. This Viking Portable volume powerfully displays the ideas of this formidable post-modern intellectual.</p><p>Peter Baehr's anthology is a gem made up of 33 selections supplemented by his highly competent introduction, a chronology covering the major events in Hannah Arendt's life, and a basic bibliography. Arendt's erudition and incisive brilliance are well represented throughout. Passages include lengthy excerpts from her major books (<i>The Origins of Totalitarianism</i>, <i>The Human Condition</i>, <i>On Revolution</i>, and <i>Eichmann in Jerusalem</i>), shorter excerpts from <i>Rahel Varnhagen</i> and <i>The Life of the Mind</i>, eight essays (four from <i>Between Past and Future</i>, one from <i>Men in Dark Times</i>, and two not previously available in book form), a University of Chicago lecture, her famous television interview with Guenter Gaus, four letters (two to Karl Jaspers, others to Mary McCarthy and Gershom Scholem), and a brief journal entry (on Heidegger "the fox"). Ever sensitive to the limitations of anthologies, particularly for the work of thinkers like Arendt, Baehr has managed to effectively convey the feel of Arendt's conscientious yet combative thinking through his selections and arrangements. <p> Arendt burst upon the world literary stage in 1951 with <i>The Origins of Totalitarianism</i> and a <i>Saturday Review</i> cover photo. She understood totalitarianism as an unprecedented phenomenon, identifying several elements that fused into it and analyzing totalitarian movements and rule. The success of <i>Origins</i> led to prestigious lectureships and 25 years of fiercely independent writing and teaching. She proved knowledgeable about philosophy as well as history and politics, fluent not only in English and German (her beloved "mother tongue") but also in French, Greek, and Latin. This precocious German Jewess had devoted her college years to studying philosophy, theology, and Greek (with Heidegger, Jaspers, Husserl, and Bultmann!), but the Nazi rise to power compelled Arendt to focus on politics, especially the Jewish question. From the '50s until her death in 1975, Arendt developed and publicly defended controversial views, including her report on the Eichmann trial and her coinage "the banality of evil"; her opposition to integrationist busing and to affirmative action hiring in universities; and her version of (classical) republicanism, rooted in her radical understandings of human action and the dignity of politics. All these views and more find expression in this collection. Of late, Arendt's fame has been rekindled by revelations of her love affair with Heidegger. Now, as we approach her birth centenary (2006), this Portable provides newcomers and faithful admirers alike a marvelous package of Arendt's writings. <i>--Richard Kenney</i></p>Hannnah Arendt (1906--1975) was for many years University Professor of Political Philosophy in the Graduate Faculty of the New School for Social Research and a Visiting Fellow of the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago. She is also the author of <i>Eichmann in Jerusalem</i>, <i>On Revolution</i>, and <i>Between Past and Future</i> (all available from Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics).<br><br>Peter Baehr is Professor of Sociology at the Memorial University of Newfoundland and the author of <i>Caesar and the Fading of the Roman World.

Not only a prolific writer for the journal, Pauline Hopkins also served as one of its powerful editorial forces. This volume of her magazine novels, which appeared serially in the journal between March 1901 and November 1903, reveals Hopkins&#39; commitment to fiction as a vehicle for social change. She weaves important political themes into the narrative formulas of nineteenth-century dime-store novels and story papers, which emphasize suspense, action, complex plotting, multiple and false identities, and the use of disguise. Offering both instruction and entertainment, Hopkins&#39; novels also expose the limitations of popular American narrative forms when telling the stories of black characters.</p><p>The Schomburg Library of Nineteenth- Century Black Women Writers series, under the general editorship of Henry Louis Gates, Jr., has rescued the voice of an entire segment of the African-American literary tradition by offering volumes of compelling and rare works of fiction, poetry, autobiography, biography, essays, and journalism, written by nineteenth-century back women.Hazel V.

His theories, many of which are illustrated in this astonishing &#39;inventory of effects&#39;, force us to question how modes of communication have shaped society. This is an astonishing work by a truly astonishing man. &#34;The Penguin on Design&#34; series includes the works of creative thinkers whose writings on art, design and the media have changed our vision forever. This is one of four books in that series.</p><p><i>The Medium is the Massage</i> is Marshall McLuhan's most condensed, and perhaps most effective, presentation of his ideas. Using a layout style that was later copied by <i>Wired</i>, McLuhan and coauthor/designer Quentin Fiore combine word and image to illustrate and enact the ideas that were first put forward in the dense and poorly organized <i>Understanding Media</i>. McLuhan's ideas about the nature of media, the increasing speed of communication, and the technological basis for our understanding of who we are come to life in this slender volume. Although originally printed in 1967, the art and style in <i>The Medium is the Massage</i> seem as fresh today as in the summer of love, and the ideas are even more resonant now that computer interfaces are becoming gateways to the global village.Marshall McLuhan was a Canadian educator, philosopher and scholar - a professor of English Literature, a literary critic and a communications theorist. McLuhan&#39;s work is viewed as one of the cornerstones of the study of media theory. McLuhan is known for coining the expressions &#39;the medium is the message&#39; and the &#39;global village&#39;.</p><h2>Crisis and Leviathan : Critical Episodes in the Growth of American Government: A Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy Book</h2><p>Few topics are as timely as the growth of government. To understand <em>why</em> government has grown, Robert Higgs asserts, one must understand <em>how</em> it has grown. This book offers a coherent, multi-causal explanation, guided by a novel analytical framework firmly grounded in historical evidence.<br> More than a study of trends in governmental spending, taxation, and employment, <em>Crisis and Leviathan</em> is a thorough analysis of the actual occasions when and the specific means by which Big Government developed in the United States. Naming names and highlighting the actions of significant individuals, Higgs examines how twentieth-century national emergencies--mainly wars, depressions, and labor disturbances--have prompted federal officials to take over previously private rights and activities. When the crises passed, a residue of new governmental powers remained. Even more significantly, each great crisis and the subsequent governmental measures have gone hand in hand with reinforcing shifts in public beliefs and attitudes toward the government's proper role in American life.<br> Integrating the contributions of scholars in diverse disciplines, including history, law, political philosophy, and the social sciences, <em>Crisis and Leviathan</em> makes compelling reading for all those who seek to understand the transformation of America's political economy over the past century.</p><p>Robert Higgs is at Seattle University.<br>"A very useful book for modern American history courses."--Frank Annunziata, <em>Rochester Institute of Technology</em><p></p><br>"Insightful, compelling, and clear.

How does it differ from "land?" Does landscape always imply something to be pictured, a scene? When and why did we begin to cherish images of nature? What is "nature?" Is it everything that isn't art, or artifact? By addressing these and many other questions, <em>Landscape and</em> <em>Western Art</em> explores the myriad ideas and images of the natural world in Western art since the Renaissance. <br> <br> Implying that land is the raw material, and that art is created by turning land into landscape, which then becomes art, author Malcolm Andrews takes the reader on a thematic tour of the fascinating and challenging issues of landscape as art. The books broad sweep covers the full, rich spectrum of landscape art, including painting, gardening, panorama, poetry, photography, and art. Artistic issues are investigated in connection with Western cultural movements, and within a full international and historical context.<br> <br> Clear explanations and beautiful illustrations convey to the reader the idea of landscape as an experience in which everyone is creatively involved. <em>Landscape and Western Art</em> provides an enlightening and comprehensive critical overview of landscape art.<br></p><p><br><strong>Malcolm Andrews</strong> is Professor of Victorian and Visual Studies at the University of Kent.

The theme of <b><i>The Ethics of Management, Sixth Edition,</i></b> is that business firms today operate in a competitively intense, technologically complex and culturally diverse global economy. Pressures to dodge issues and cut corners are greater than ever before. <i>The Ethics of Management</i> by LaRue Hosmer provides a very explicit three-part framework to analyze those problems by combining economic outcomes, legal requirements and ethical principles. Students will learn how to convincingly present their moral point of view to others in order to jointly serve their companies, protect their careers, and improve their societies.</p><p></p><h2>No Sweat: How the Simple Science of Motivation Can Bring You a Lifetime of Fitness</h2><p>"When it comes to exercise, most of us have gotten the message but still lack the motivation.

To achieve lasting fitness, we have to change our minds&#x2014;before we can change our bodies. In <i><b>No Sweat</b></i>, Segar shows us how.

Leadership is a living process&#x2014;and life means growth. As Ken Blanchard and Mark Miller write in the introduction, &#x201c;the path to increased influence, impact, and leadership effectiveness is paved with personal growth.... Our capacity to grow determines our capacity to lead. It&#x2019;s really that simple.&#x201d; <i>Great Leaders Grow</i> shows leaders and aspiring leaders precisely which areas to focus on so they can remain effective throughout their lives.<br><br> Debbie Brewster&#x2014;the protagonist from Blanchard and Miller&#x2019;s international bestseller <i>The Secret</i>&#x2014;returns in this book to mentor her mentor&#x2019;s son, Blake, as he begins his career. Now an accomplished leader herself, Debbie shows Blake how growing as a leader and as a human being are inextricably linked. &#x201c;How well you and I serve will be determined by the decision to grow or not,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Will you be a leader who is always ready to face the next challenge? Or will you be a leader who tries to apply yesterday&#x2019;s solutions to today&#x2019;s problems?&#x201d; <br><br> As Blake confronts the challenges of business in the real world, he turns to Debbie for guidance. Step by step, Debbie and Blake explore the GROW model&#x2014;four ways that leaders must challenge and stretch themselves, both on the job and off, to fulfill their highest potential. <br><br> Whether you&#x2019;re a CEO or an entry-level employee, this book will inspire you to reflect on your life and design your own long-term growth plan&#x2014;a plan that can lead not only to continuing professional success but to personal fulfillment as well.</p><p>Ken Blanchard is chief spiritual officer of the Ken Blanchard Companies. He is the author or coauthor of fifty books that have sold more than 20 million copies, including the iconic One Minute Manager�. <br> Mark Miller began his Chick-fil-A career working as an hourly team member and is currently vice president of training and development. In over thirty years with Chick-fil-A, Mark has served in numerous roles, providing leadership in restaurant operations, quality and customer satisfaction, and corporate communications. He is the coauthor, with Ken Blanchard, of the international bestseller The Secret.Introduction<br><br> Have you ever felt like you could lead at a higher level but you weren&#x2019;t quite sure how to get there? Have you ever wondered how to strengthen your influence and increase your impact? Have you ever considered what enables some leaders to soar above all others? We&#x2019;ve asked these questions and more just like them. We&#x2019;re convinced, after more than seventy years of combined leadership, that the path to increased influence, impact, and leadership effectiveness is paved with personal growth. There&#x2019;s certainly more to leadership than growth, but growth is at the heart of what creates and sustains great leaders. Growth is the leader&#x2019;s fountain of youth.<br><br> Growing for a leader is like oxygen to a deep sea diver: without it you die. Unlike the diver, you may not physically die&#x2014;but if you stop growing, your influence will erode; and over time, you can even lose the opportunity to lead at all.<br><br> Tragically, you see these losses in organizations large and small, for profit and not for profit&#x2014;leaders who attain a position of leadership and fail to keep up. Or some get a promotion based on their potential, but that potential never materializes. Or perhaps you see it in young emerging leaders who never get their shot. Their untapped potential remains untapped. What do all these situations have in common? Personal growth&#x2014;or the lack of it. The failure to grow sabotages the career of more leaders than anything else.<br><br> Our capacity to grow determines our capacity to lead. It&#x2019;s really that simple. However, simple doesn&#x2019;t mean easy. Like most of life&#x2019;s powerful principles, the power is in the application. That&#x2019;s what this book is all about.<br><br> In the pages that follow, you&#x2019;ll go along for the ride of a lifetime with Blake, an energetic yet reluctant emerging leader. Don&#x2019;t get hung up on his age or lack of experience. There&#x2019;s some of Blake in all of us, particularly when we&#x2019;re faced with the challenge of growing as a leader.<br><br> Debbie Brewster plays the part of trusted mentor to Blake and shares with him four big ideas that, if applied consistently, will enable him to be a leader for life.<br><br> The idea of leading for the rest of our lives is appealing to us. We may not choose to lead in our current context or circumstances indefinitely, but name a leader you know who wants to become stagnant or, worse, irrelevant. We don&#x2019;t know any. If you decide that you want to lead well your entire life&#x2014;whether in the marketplace, a nonprofit, or even in your family&#x2014;you must continue to grow.<br><br> We pray that the ideas in this book will fuel your passion to grow, convince you that you can grow, show you how to grow, and empower you to grow for the rest of your life. Have fun as you GROW!<br><br> &#x2014;Ken Blanchard and Mark Miller</p><h2>Debussy</h2><p>Claude Debussy was that rare creature, a composer who reinvented the language of music without alienating the majority of music lovers. He is the modernist everyone loves. How did he manage this? Was it through the association of his music with visual images, or was it simply that, by throwing out the rule book of the Paris Conservatoire where he studied, his music put beauty of sound above the spiritual ambitions of the German tradition from which those rules derived.<br><br> Stephen Walsh&#x2019;s thought-provoking biography, told partly through the events of Debussy&#x2019;s life, and partly through a critical discussion of his music, addresses these and other questions about one of the most influential composers of the early twentieth century.</p><p><b>Stephen Walsh</b> is a Professor of Music at Cardiff University, and the author of several books on music, including <i>Musorgsky and His Circle</i> (Faber, 2013) which was shortlisted for the Pushkin House Russian Book Prize in 2014.

In 2011, New York photographer Brian Kelley began documenting collections of used MetroCards in his Brooklyn studio, arranging them in various grids with the goal of perfecting the lighting of an image. His brother suggested he make the grids more interesting by finding other types of cards. Having exhausted his search for discarded MetroCards in many of the city's 472 subway stations, Kelley turned to eBay for new finds. The online rabbit-hole gave him a crash course in the history of NYC transportation. He discovered tokens dating back to 1860, a ticket stub from 1885 when it cost three cents to take the train across the Brooklyn Bridge, as well as patches, matchbooks, tokens, timetables, pins and signs, posting his photographs of these finds on Tumblr and Instagram. Six years on, many MTA employees follow and advocate his project, sometimes contacting him with information and tips on rare items. As the collection grew, Kelley recognized that there were no comparable digital archives documenting the city's transportation evolution.</p><p><i>New York City Transit Authority: Objects</i> is a story told through the evolving design that spans decades of the city's history. Kelley's objects tell a greater story of New York's past. For him, The NYCTA Project remains a photography experiment and self-funded hobby, archiving the culture of his home city. For the reader, it's an intimate view of the city's history that merges design and infrastructure over the past 150 years.</p></p><p>An Illuminating History of Modern Graphic Design--Edward M. Gomez &#34;Hyperallergic &#34;</p><h2>The Rise and Fall of Classical Greece (The Princeton History of the Ancient World, 1)</h2><p><p><b>A major new history of classical Greece&#x2015;how it rose, how it fell, and what we can learn from it</b></p><p>Lord Byron described Greece as great, fallen, and immortal, a characterization more apt than he knew. Through most of its long history, Greece was poor. But in the classical era, Greece was densely populated and highly urbanized. Many surprisingly healthy Greeks lived in remarkably big houses and worked for high wages at specialized occupations. Middle-class spending drove sustained economic growth and classical wealth produced a stunning cultural efflorescence lasting hundreds of years.</p><p>Why did Greece reach such heights in the classical period&#x2015;and why only then? And how, after "the Greek miracle" had endured for centuries, did the Macedonians defeat the Greeks, seemingly bringing an end to their glory? Drawing on a massive body of newly available data and employing novel approaches to evidence, Josiah Ober offers a major new history of classical Greece and an unprecedented account of its rise and fall.</p><p>Ober argues that Greece's rise was no miracle but rather the result of political breakthroughs and economic development. The extraordinary emergence of citizen-centered city-states transformed Greece into a society that defeated the mighty Persian Empire. Yet Philip and Alexander of Macedon were able to beat the Greeks in the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BCE, a victory made possible by the Macedonians' appropriation of Greek innovations. After Alexander's death, battle-hardened warlords fought ruthlessly over the remnants of his empire. But Greek cities remained populous and wealthy, their economy and culture surviving to be passed on to the Romans&#x2015;and to us.</p><p>A compelling narrative filled with uncanny modern parallels, this is a book for anyone interested in how great civilizations are born and die.</p><p>This book is based on evidence available on a new interactive website.

C. Boyle, John Edgar Wideman, Amos Oz, Kazuo Ishiguro, Peter Hoeg, Vikram Chandra, Raymond Carver, and many others. 12,500 first printing.</p><p>A reader doesn't want to love every story in an anthology. A collection of short fiction by various authors should be just that: various. We want all the stories to be admirable, but not necessarily lovable. This is how anthologies do their job, which is to teach us to love new forms of fiction. And this is how Daniel Halpern, editor of <i>The Art of the Story</i>, does his job. Halpern previously brought us the successful and far-reaching collection <i>The Art of the Tale</i>. Now he has taken upon himself the task of creating an international sampling of the contemporary short story. Seventy-eight writers from 35 countries--including Banana Yoshimoto, Junot D�az, Peter Hoeg, Julian Barnes, T.C. Boyle, Salman Rushdie, Peter Carey, Edwidge Danticat, and Tatyana Tolstaya--demonstrate that the story still brims with unrest and disharmony and, well, variousness. The classical form, the story that implies the world in a truncated scene or two, that implies a life in a single moment, is amply represented in this collection by writers like Ann Beattie ("In Amalfi") and Raymond Carver ("Are These Actual Miles?"). But the new story ranges farther than the personal, making inroads into the parodic, the fantastic, the speculative. As Halpern writes in the preface, "There seems to be a more investigative nature to the fiction of these stories written so close to the end of this century, a tendency, especially among writers from emerging nations, to use the story as a means of orientation, to restate for themselves their position--politically, socially, and artistically--as if for these writers there is radically less separation between reality and the imagination." Certainly this is an apt description of the fiction of Nigeria's Booker Prize winner Ben Okri ("In the Shadow of War") and of American newcomer Nathan Englander, whose "The Twenty-Seventh Man" describes the slaughter of Yiddish writers and contains the unforgettable dictate, "Never outlive your language." <i>--Claire Dederer</i><b>Daniel Halpern</b> is the author of eight collections of poetry, and has received numerous grants and awards (including fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts, as well as the 1993 PEN Publisher Citation).

Brutal. Male. One of these stereotypes of the Ku Klux Klan offer a misleading picture. In <i>Women of the Klan</i>, sociologist Kathleen Blee unveils an accurate portrait of a racist movement that appealed to ordinary people throughout the country. In so doing, she dismantles the popular notion that politically involved women are always inspired by pacifism, equality, and justice.<br><br>"All the better people," a former Klanswoman assures us, were in the Klan. During the 1920s, perhaps half a million white native-born Protestant women joined the Women's Ku Klux Klan (WKKK). Like their male counterparts, Klanswomen held reactionary views on race, nationality, and religion. But their perspectives on gender roles were often progressive. The Klan publicly asserted that a women's order could safeguard women's suffrage and expand their other legal rights. Privately the WKKK was working to preserve white Protestant supremacy.<br><br>Blee draws from extensive archival research and interviews with former Klan members and victims to underscore the complexity of extremist right-wing political movements. Issues of women's rights, she argues, do not fit comfortably into the standard dichotomies of "progressive" and "reactionary." These need to be replaced by a more complete understanding of how gender politics are related to the politics of race, religion, and class.</p><p><b>Kathleen M. Blee</b> is Professor of Sociology at the University of Pittsburgh."A meticulous job of historical sleuthing. . . . This down-home side of the K.K.K. in the 1920s resembles not so much the terrorist Klan of today as the myriad white supremacist groups that rally behind the 'new' David Duke." -- <i>Claudia Koonz, New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"Thanks to Kathleen M. Blee's superb scholarship in Women of the Klan I must now live with the fact that the Klan contained 'all the better people': businessmen, physicians, judges, social workers (even Quakers, political reformers and (this is the truly discomforting part) feminists. . . . Women of the Klan stands before us as carefully garnered, irrefutable evidence that women are capable of asserting their gender rights in the most noisome settings." -- <i>Barbara Ehrenreich, Los Angeles Times</i><br><br>"The author's interviews with women who were dedicated members of the Klan in the 1920s are original and remarkable. . . .The hypocrisy revealed in Women of the Klan could easily translate as the stuff of fiction." -- <i>Herbert Mitgang, New York Times</i><br><br>"[A] superb new book on women in the 1920s Ku Klux Klan . . . . Blee's insight is crucial if we are to uncover, and grasp, the depth of white supremacy." -- <i>Dana Frank, The Nation</i></p><h2>Foundry Manual</h2><p>This Manual is intended primarily for use by foundry personnel aboard repair ships and tenders.

The second section, chapters 14 through 21, contains information on specific types of alloys, such as &#34;Copper-Base Alloys,&#34; &#34;Aluminum-Base Alloys,&#34; &#34;Cast Iron,&#34; and &#34;Steel.&#34; Specific melting practices, suggestions for sand mixes, molding practices, gating, and risering are covered in these chapters. This manual has been written with the &#34;how-to-do-it&#34; idea as the principal aim. Discussions as to the &#34;why&#34; of certain procedures have been kept to a minimum. This manual contains information that should result in the production of consistently better castings by repair ship personnel.</p><p></p><h2>Wuthering Heights (Leatherbound Classic Collection) by Emily Bronte (2011) Leather Bound</h2><p>This is Emily Bronte's classic novel in a beautiful leatherbound edition.

Retiring from the Air Force in 1970 as a three-star general, he served in a number of civilian posts, including director of public safety for the city of Cleveland and assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation. Davis enjoyed an almost unbroken string of successes in his military and civilian careers, the only major exception being a municipal job in Cleveland from which he resigned for political reasons. What lends the autobiography historical significance is Davis's account of the struggle to gain professional recognition not only for himself but for all black servicemen in the face of segregation, institutional racial prejudice and local bigotry. A revealing look at race relations from the point of view of a gifted, uncompromising military man. Photos. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.YA-- An autobiography of the first African American to graduate from West Point in the 20th century. Although he was not wanted at that institution, Davis graduated 35th in a class of 276. His first assignment was at Fort Benning, Georgia, where he was rejected by the Officers' Club. The turning point of his career came when he was asked by the Roosevelt Administration to lead the all-black 99th Fighter Squadron. Davis and his squadron silenced critics with aerial victories over Anzio in two successive days in January, 1944. He later served as director of Civilian Aviation Security and as assistant secretary for Environment, Safety and Consumer Affairs at the Department of Transportation.

In this boxed set, Leslie Klinger, a leading world authority, reassembles Arthur Conan Doyle's 56 classic short stories in the order in which they appeared in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century book editions. Inside, readers will find a cornucopia of insights: beginners will benefit from Klinger's insightful biographies of Holmes, Watson, and Conan Doyle; history lovers will revel in the wealth of Victorian literary and cultural details; Sherlockian fanatics will puzzle over tantalizing new theories; art lovers will thrill to the 800-plus illustrations, which make this the most lavishly illustrated edition of the Holmes tales ever produced. <em>The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes</em> illuminates the timeless genius of Arthur Conan Doyle for an entirely new generation of readers. Two-color text throughout; 800+ illustrations</p><p><p><strong>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</strong> (1859-1930) is most noted for his Sherlock Holmes detective stories. He was a prolific writer whose other works include a wide range of science fiction stories, historical novels, romances, poetry, and nonfiction.</p><p><strong>Leslie S. Klinger</strong> is the editor of numerous books, including the best-selling <em>The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes</em>, <em>The New Annotated Dracula</em>, and <em>The New Annotated H. P. Lovecraft</em>. He lives in Malibu, California.</p><p><strong>John le Carr�</strong> is a noted English author of espionage novels. His many acclaimed books include <i>The Spy Who Came in from the Cold; Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy; The Tailor of Panama</i>; <i>The Russia House</i>, and <i>The Constant Gardener.</i></p>"Poor Holmes is dead and damned," remarked Arthur Conan Doyle in 1896, soon after consigning the famous detective to death at the Reichenbach Falls. "I have had such an overdose of him that I feel towards him as I do towards pat� de foie gras, of which I once ate too much, so that the name of it gives me a sickly feeling to this day."<p>Needless to say, Sherlock Holmes did not go gentle into that good night but came raging back to face a further series of perils, including a spectral hound, a sinister air gun and an exotic Asiatic poison. Even the death of Conan Doyle did not bring about any noticeable slowing of Holmes's career. Though the "official" adventures -- 56 short stories and four longer tales known as "The Canon" -- came to a close more than 75 years ago, the detective continues to enjoy a robust career in books, movies, television programs, musicals, plays and even a ballet. </p><p>Along the way he has acquired a cult of followers whose devotion borders on the mystical. Sherlockians, as they call themselves, can be found in every corner of the globe -- and, increasingly, on the Internet -- discussing such matters as the depth to which a sprig of parsley might sink in butter on a hot day, and the true location of Dr. Watson's strangely transient war wound. Ask a Holmes buff for news of the giant rat of Sumatra, and he or she will answer, gently, that it is a tale for which the world is not yet prepared.</p><p>"What is it that makes this subject inexhaustible?" asked the noted Sherlockian Edgar W. Smith in 1952. "There is nothing like it, to one's knowledge, in all the field of literature. Not Robinson Crusoe, nor Mr. Pickwick, nor yet great Hamlet has been so honored by the imp of the inquisitive. . . . Ivanhoe and Hiawatha, Dr. Jekyll and David Copperfield, Hercules and George Babbitt -- who cares if they were married once or twice, or how profound their knowledge of the Solar System may have been? We know just where Achilles had his wound, and we let it go at that. . . . But Sherlock Holmes is different." Author Christopher Morley, reviewing a torrent of submissions to the fledgling Baker Street Journal, put the matter more succinctly: "Never has so much been written by so many for so few."</p><p>It is a problem that Leslie S. Klinger confronts with remarkable success and good cheer in his new annotated edition of the Sherlock Holmes short stories. As Klinger knows full well, the original tales have now been picked over so many times that it is fair to wonder what is left to say. Indeed, there has already been a two-volume annotated edition, edited by William S. Baring-Gould, which appeared in 1968, and, more recently, a distinguished nine-volume edition from Oxford University Press. </p><p>"I set out to create for this edition an annotated set that reflects the spectrum of views on Sherlockian controversies rather than my own theories," writes Klinger in his preface. "In addition, this work brings current Baring-Gould's long-outdated survey of the literature, including references to hundreds of works published subsequently. Recognizing that many of the events recorded in the stories took place in England over 100 to 150 years ago, it also includes much background information on the Victorian age, its history, culture, and vocabulary."</p><p>The result is a beautiful and thoroughly enjoyable edition that somehow manages to synthesize all that has come before, and will appeal to both first-time readers and seasoned veterans. The lavish boxed set presents all the original short stories in the order of their publication (setting aside the eccentric chronology of the earlier annotated edition) and will be followed next year by a third volume devoted to the four longer stories -- including, of course, The Hound of the Baskervilles. An evocative preface by John le Carr� is followed by an informative essay from Klinger, offering useful background on Holmes and his world. More than 800 illustrations are scattered throughout the text, many of them culled from the magazines in which the stories first appeared. Periodic sidebars guide the reader through potentially rocky terrain such as the Boer War; the rules of rugby; and baritsu, the obscure Japanese system of self-defense that proved so helpful to Holmes at the Reichenbach Falls. </p><p>For many readers, the most useful feature will be the annotations running alongside the text, which illuminate unfamiliar or obscure details without breaking the flow of the stories. Klinger brings an admirable clarity and precision to this task. In the opening pages of "A Scandal in Bohemia," for instance, when Watson is directed toward a spirit case, Klinger offers this helpful note:</p><p>"A 'spirit case' or 'tantalus' is a stand containing usually three cut-glass decanters, which, though apparently free, cannot be removed until the bar that engages the stoppers is raised. Many such cases have a padlock on the bar, to avoid 'tantalizing' the servants." An illustration from the Harrod's catalogue of 1895 completes our edification.</p><p>If there is any fault to be noted, it is that Klinger must occasionally find an awkward perch between scholarship and whimsy as he struggles to maintain what he calls "the gentle fiction that Holmes and Watson really lived." For example, an admirable discussion of the life of Conan Doyle is followed immediately by a somewhat frivolous speculation as to when Conan Doyle and Dr. Watson might have met: "Perhaps these two young writers met in Edinburgh . . . or perhaps their similar medical backgrounds led them to the same lecture." In Sherlockian circles this is known as "playing the game," and it has been raised to an art form in such societies as the Baker Street Irregulars, but newcomers may feel themselves excluded. Klinger wisely keeps it in the background for the most part.</p><p>Perhaps I am betraying my own prejudices. In the spirit of full disclosure, I should mention that my own work on this subject -- a biography of Conan Doyle -- is generously acknowledged in these pages, and I should also mention that I see Klinger once a year at the January meeting of the Baker Street Irregulars, where he manages the not inconsiderable feat of appearing stylish and au courant in a tuxedo. I am grateful for the former and rather jealous of the latter, but I trust that neither has unduly influenced my opinion.</p><p>At some 1,800 pages, with the additional volume to come, The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes is a considerable undertaking, and some readers may balk at its sheer heft. One could do worse than to heed the advice of le Carr�: "Do not be dismayed," he writes in his preface. "Nobody writes of Holmes and Watson without love." </p><p>Reviewed by Daniel Stashower <br>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

Open to the public yet hardly advertised, it is a secret garden everyone may share.<br>Set in 200 acres in Millbrook, New York, some 90 miles from New York City, Innisfree was the private preserve of Walter and Marion Beck from 1929 to 1960. It was then bequeathed to The Innisfree Foundation, under the trusteeship of landscape architect Lester Collins.<br>Inspired by the scroll paintings of eighth-century Chinese poet-painter Wang Wei's garden, Beck created a series of self-contained landscapes using natural elements to frame and fill exquisite pictures. Collins followed the practical directives of the Sensai Hisho, or Secret Garden Book, an ancient Japanese handbook, to transform these individual gardens into a stroll that allows the visitor to move seamlessly from one scene to the next. By the time he died in 1993, he had doubled the size of an already vast and elaborate private garden, needing 20 full-time gardeners, while converting it into a public garden that is maintained by a staff of five.<br>In this volume, beautifully illustrated with his own photographs and others specially commissioned for it, Collins reveals the magic of Innisfree, from its underlying Eastern philosophy of landscape art to construction details that cause subtle variations in the sound of water. He describes how water sculptures are powered by gravity to combine Chinese art with 20th-century technology and how the rocks and natural features of the whole environment are used to create beauty. An art form, normally seen only in stylized images of pagodas and dragons, is reinterpreted here in a natural landscape in which maintenance has been reduced without compromise to esthetics. Built with the wisdom and principles of the East, Innisfree remains a completely American garden.</p><p>Set on 200 acres in Millbrook, New York, Innisfree was created by Walter &amp; Marion Beck as a series of "cup gardens" inspired by scroll paintings of an 8th-century Chinese garden. Lester Collins extended the garden over several decades into a seamless whole, a distinctively American interpretation of ancient design principles.Lester Collins was Dean of the Harvard University School of Landscape Architecture before going into private practice in Washington, D.C., in 1953.</p><h2>The White War: Life and Death on the Italian Front 1915-1919</h2><p>In May 1915, Italy declared war on the Habsburg Empire. Nearly 750,000 Italian troops were killed in savage, hopeless fighting on the stony hills north of Trieste and in the snows of the Dolomites. To maintain discipline, General Luigi Cadorna restored the Roman practice of decimation, executing random members of units that retreated or rebelled.<p>With elegance and pathos, historian Mark Thompson relates the saga of the Italian front, the nationalist frenzy and political intrigues that preceded the conflict, and the towering personalities of the statesmen, generals, and writers drawn into the heart of the chaos. A work of epic scale, <i>The White War</i> does full justice to the brutal and heart-wrenching war that inspired Hemingway's <i>A Farewell to Arms</i>.</p></p><p><b>Mark Thompson</b> holds a PhD in Social Sciences from Cambridge. The author of <i>Forging War</i> and <i>A Paper House</i>, he lives in Oxford, England.Hundreds of thousands of men are fed into a meat grinder in futile charges against entrenched positions; opposing armies are forging a weird sense of camaraderie as they fraternize during lulls in the slaughter; and rows of rotting corpses are scattered over a bleak, pockmarked landscape. But this isn&#x2019;t the familiar western front in France. Rather, these stark images are part of a stunning and emotionally wrenching account of war between Austria and Italy over the disputed terrain they both claimed. Although the struggle was recounted in the writings of Ernest Hemingway, the Italian front was regarded as a sideshow by many European journalists as well as Allied war planners. Whatever the strategic value of the campaign, Thompson illustrates that this was a massive, epic struggle that may have cost a million lives. He crafts a narrative rich in detail and which does not shrink from describing the horrors of a war that began, on the Italian side, in a spasm of wild nationalistic fervor but quickly degenerated into resigned cynicism. This is a masterful and moving chronicle. --Jay Freeman</p><h2>PRE-ALGEBRA STUDENT WORKBOOK</h2><p><strong>The bridge to algebra</strong> <p>Help your students make a smooth transition from basic math to algebra. <em>Pre-Algebra</em> is written for the needs of the beginning algebra student.

After the Reformation it concentrates on the rites of the Roman Catholic church and the Church of England. Harper discusses the nature of liturgy and provides an historical summary and individual chapters on medieval churches and their communities, the Christian calendar, medieval liturgical books, the Psalms, the Office, the Mass, Processions and Additional Observances, Holy Week and Easter, the Tridentine Rite, and the English Book of Common Prayer.

Each Future Volume will build on the prior Volumes, but could be read as a stand-alone book. The idea is to allow the reader greater flexibility in choosing what interests them and what they find helpful to them. For example, this one is aimed obviously at those considering the idea of starting a small backyard herd of meat rabbits, but does NOT actually get into any aspects of harming any. It stops short of that. So, if one can overlook references to "meat" rabbits, it could be helpful to those interested in having outdoor pet rabbits too. There are many books about raising rabbits. I find most very general, including information on keeping rabbits as pets, raising rabbits for show, and breeding rabbits to sell to processors for profit. This book will focus specifically on, and only on sharing with the reader our personal experiences and methods of raising meat rabbits on our 120&#x2019;x120&#x2019; city lot in Michigan as self-sufficient meat for our family. It stops short of the actual harvesting process. I&#x2019;m often on my soapbox in support of the argument that it&#x2019;s easier for a family to &#x201c;need less&#x201d; than to &#x201c;spend more&#x201d; money to buy quality food. Done our way, rabbit meat can cost close to zero after the initial setup is paid for. There are no taxes to pay, no middleman, no anything. It&#x2019;s just like we&#x2019;ve added a meat section to our garden! Then, just like we do with our extra tomatoes, zucchini and cucumbers from our garden, we can share or trade with our neighbors who don&#x2019;t have any. It&#x2019;s that simple. Backyard Meat Rabbits can benefit every family on the planet, in my humble opinion. Next in the series: The Urban Rabbit Project Volume 2 Beyond The Pellet - Feeding Rabbits Naturally In Volume 2, I am joined by a gentleman with over 30 years of knowledge and experience in feeding meat rabbits. Mr. Rick Worden, owner of Rise And Shine Rabbitry and RiseAndShineRabbitry.com will share with us his take on going Beyond The Pellet. Like myself, Rick has worked extensively at moving away from commercial feed and towards natural feed for our rabbits. We write this together, aimed at a more advanced audience of Rabbiteers looking to take control of what their rabbits eat, what their feed costs are and ultimately what they eat.</p><p>Boyd Craven Jr was born in Flint, Michigan, USA on December 7, 1957.

J. Leatherbarrow; Translation by Richard Pevear and Larissa VolokhonskyFyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky was born in Moscow in 1821, the second of a physician&#39;s seven children. His mother died in 1837 and his father was murdered a little over two years later. When he left his private boarding school in Moscow he studied from 1838 to 1843 at the Military Engineering College in St Petersburg, graduating with officer&#39;s rank. His first story to be published, &#39;Poor Folk&#39; (1846), was a great success. In 1849 he was arrested and sentenced to death for participating in the &#39;Petrashevsky circle&#39;; he was reprieved at the last moment but sentenced to penal servitude, and until 1854 he lived in a convict prison at Omsk, Siberia. In the decade following his return from exile he wrote The Village of Stepanchikovo (1859) and The House of the Dead (1860). Whereas the latter draws heavily on his experiences in prison, the former inhabits a completely different world, shot through with comedy and satire. In 1861 he began the review Vremya (Time) with his brother; in 1862 and 1863 he went abroad, where he strengthened his anti-European outlook, met Mlle Suslova, who was the model for many of his heroines, and gave way to his passion for gambling. In the following years he fell deeply in debt, but in 1867 he married Anna Grigoryevna Snitkina (his second wife), who helped to rescue him from his financial morass. They lived abroad for four years, then in 1873 he was invited to edit Grazhdanin (The Citizen), to which he contributed his Diary of a Writer. From 1876 the latter was issued separately and had a large circulation. In 1880 he delivered his famous address at the unveiling of Pushkin&#39;s memorial in Moscow; he died six months later in 1881. Most of his important works were written after 1864: Notes from Underground (1864), Crime and Punishment (1865-6), The Gambler (1866), The Idiot (1869), The Devils (1871) and The Brothers Karamazov (1880).</p><h2>Learning Classical Tibetan: A Reader for Translating Buddhist Texts</h2><p><b><b>A modern and accessible reader of Classical Tibetan Buddhist texts based on the traditional monastic educational system, designed for both classroom use and independent study</b></b><br><br>Designed for both classroom use and independent study, <i>Learning Classical Tibetan</i> is a modern and accessible reader for studying traditional Buddhist texts.

ONE<p></p> Curious<p></p> <br>INDEPENDENT OF THEIR LENGTH, SOME stories can leave lasting impressions. &#x201c;The Story of an Hour,&#x201d; a very short tale by the nineteenth-century author Kate Chopin, opens with a rather startling sentence: &#x201c;Knowing that Mrs. Mallard was afflicted with a heart trouble, great care was taken to break to her as gently as possible the news of her husband&#x2019;s death.&#x201d; Loss of life and human frailty all packed into one punchy line. We then learn that it was the husband&#x2019;s close friend, Richards, who brought the bad news, after having confirmed (by way of a telegram) that Brently Mallard&#x2019;s name was indeed leading the list of those killed in a railroad disaster.<br> <br>In Chopin&#x2019;s plot, Mrs. Mallard&#x2019;s immediate reaction is a natural one. Upon hearing the sad message from her sister Josephine, she starts weeping straightaway, then retires to her room, asking to be left alone. It is there, however, that something totally unexpected happens. After sitting motionless, sobbing for a while, her gaze apparently fixed on a distant patch of blue sky, Mrs. Mallard starts whispering a surprising word to herself: &#x201c;Free, free, free!&#x201d; This is followed by an even more exuberant &#x201c;Free! Body and soul free!&#x201d;<br> <br>When she finally opens the door, yielding to Josephine&#x2019;s worried requests, Mrs. Mallard emerges with &#x201c;a feverish triumph in her eyes.&#x201d; She starts to calmly descend the steps, clutching to her sister&#x2019;s waist, while her husband&#x2019;s friend Richards awaits them at the bottom of the staircase. That&#x2019;s precisely when someone is heard opening the front door with a latchkey.<br> <br>Chopin&#x2019;s story contains only eight more lines beyond this point. Could we perhaps stop reading here? Needless to say, even if we wanted to, we probably wouldn&#x2019;t, certainly not without at least knowing who was at the door. As the English essayist Charles Lamb wrote, &#x201c;Not many sounds in life, and I include all urban and all rural sounds, exceed in interest a knock at the door.&#x201d; That is the power of a story that pulls your attention with such force that you don&#x2019;t even dream of overriding that pull.<br> <br>The person entering the house is indeed, as you might have guessed, Brently Mallard, who, it turns out, had been so far from the scene of the train accident that he didn&#x2019;t even know it had happened. The vivid description of the emotional roller-coaster ride that the temperamental Mrs. Mallard has had to endure in the span of just one hour turns reading Chopin&#x2019;s drama into a riveting experience.<br> <br>The last sentence in &#x201c;The Story of an Hour&#x201d; is even more unsettling than the first one: &#x201c;When the doctors came they said she had died of heart disease&#x2014;of joy that kills.&#x201d; The inner life of Mrs. Mallard remains largely a mystery to us.<br> <br>Chopin&#x2019;s greatest gift, in my opinion, is her singular ability to generate curiosity with almost every single line of prose, even in passages describing situations in which apparently nothing happens. This is the type of curiosity that results from chills running up and down your spine, somewhat similar to the sensation you feel when listening to exceptional pieces of music. Those are subtle, intellectual cliffhangers that constitute a necessary device in any compelling storytelling, lesson at school, stimulating artistic oeuvre, video game, advertising campaign, or even simple conversation that delights rather than bores. Chopin&#x2019;s story inspires what has been dubbed empathic curiosity&#x2014;the standpoint we adopt when we try to understand the desires, emotional experiences, and thoughts of the protagonist and when her or his actions incessantly bother us with the nagging question Why?<br> <br>Another element that Chopin aptly uses is that of surprise. This is a sure stratagem to kindle curiosity through heightened arousal and attention. New York University neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux and his colleagues managed to trace the pathways within our brain that are responsible for the reaction to surprise or fear. When we encounter the unexpected, the brain assumes that some action may have to be taken. This results in a rapid activation of the sympathetic nervous system, with its familiar, associated manifestations: increased heart rate, perspiration, and deep breathing. At the same time, attention is diverted from other, irrelevant stimuli and is focused on the key pressing element under consideration. LeDoux was able to show that in surprise, and in particular in fear response, fast and slow pathways are concurrently activated. The fast track proceeds directly from the thalamus, which is responsible for relaying sensory signals, to the amygdala, an almond-shaped cluster of nuclei that assigns affective significance and directs the emotional response. The slow track involves a lengthy detour between the thalamus and the amygdala that passes through the cerebral cortex, the outer layer of neural tissue that plays a key role in memory and thought. This indirect route allows for a more careful, conscious evaluation of the stimulus and for a thoughtful response.<br> <br>Several &#x201c;types&#x201d; of curiosity&#x2014;that itch to find out more&#x2014;exist. British Canadian psychologist Daniel Berlyne charted curiosity along two main dimensions or axes: one extending between perceptual and epistemic curiosity and the other traversing from specific to diversive curiosity. Perceptual curiosity is engendered by extreme outliers, by novel, ambiguous, or puzzling stimuli, and it motivates visual inspection&#x2014;think, for example, of the reaction of Asian children in a remote village seeing a Caucasian for the first time. Perceptual curiosity generally diminishes with continued exposure. Opposite perceptional curiosity in Berlyne&#x2019;s scheme is epistemic curiosity, which is the veritable desire for knowledge (the &#x201c;appetite for knowledge&#x201d; in the words of philosopher Immanuel Kant). That curiosity has been the main driver of all basic scientific research and of philosophical inquiry, and it probably was the force that propelled all the early spiritual quests. The seventeenth-century philosopher Thomas Hobbes dubbed it &#x201c;lust of the mind,&#x201d; adding that &#x201c;by a perseverence of delight in the continual and indefatigable generation of knowledge&#x201d; it exceeds &#x201c;the short vehemence of any carnal pleasure&#x201d; in that indulging in it only leaves you wanting more. Hobbes saw in this &#x201c;desire to know why&#x201d; (emphasis added) the characteristic distinguishing humankind from all other living creatures. Indeed, as we shall see in chapter 7, it has been the unique ability to ask &#x201c;Why?&#x201d; that has brought our species to where we are today. Epistemic curiosity is the curiosity Einstein alluded to when he told one of his biographers, &#x201c;I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious.&#x201d;<br> <br>To Berlyne, specific curiosity reflects the desire for a particular piece of information, as in attempts to solve a crossword puzzle or to remember the name of the movie you saw last week. Specific curiosity can drive investigators into examining distinct problems in order to understand them better and identify potential solutions. Finally, diversive curiosity refers both to the restless desire to explore and to the seeking of novel stimulation to avoid boredom. Today, this type of curiosity might manifest itself in the constant checking for new text messages or emails or in impatience while waiting for a new smartphone model. Sometimes, diversive curiosity can lead to specific curiosity, in that the novelty-seeking behavior may fuel a specific interest.<br> <br>While Berlyne&#x2019;s distinctions among different types of curiosity have proven to be extremely fruitful in many psychological studies, they should be regarded only as suggestive until a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying curiosity emerges. At the same time, a few other types of curiosity have been suggested, such as the empathic curiosity mentioned earlier, which do not neatly fall into Berlyne&#x2019;s categories. There is, for instance, the morbid curiosity that results in rubbernecking; it invariably impels drivers to slow down and examine accidents on the highway and prompts people to gather en masse around scenes of violent crimes and building fires. This is the type of curiosity that reputedly generated a huge number of Google hits for the gruesome video showing the beheading of British construction worker Ken Bigley in Iraq in 2004.<br> <br>In addition to the potentially different kinds, there are also varying levels of intensity that one can associate with assorted genres of curiosity. Sometimes just a snippet of information would suffice to satisfy the curiosity, as in some of the cases of specific curiosity: Who was it who said, &#x201c;Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere&#x201d;? In other instances, curiosity can propel someone into a passionate lifelong journey, as is occasionally the case when epistemic curiosity shepherds scientific inquiry: How did life on Earth emerge and evolve? There are also clear individual differences in curiosity, in terms of the frequency of its occurrence, the intensity level, the amount of time people are prepared to devote to exploration, and in general the openness to and preference for novel experiences. For one person, an old bottle washing ashore on Amrum Island on the German North Sea coast may be just that: a disintegrating symbol of pollution. For another, such a find could trigger an opportunity for a glimpse into an earlier, fascinating world. A message in a bottle found in April 2015 proved to be from sometime between 1904 and 1906&#x2014;the oldest-known message in a bottle. This was part of an experiment to study ocean currents.<br> <br>Similarly, Ed Shevlin, a twenty-two-year New York City sanitation worker who collects trash five mornings a week, felt such great enthusiasm for the Gaelic language of Ireland that he enrolled in an NYU master&#x2019;s degree program in Irish American studies.<br> <br>About two decades ago, a rare astronomical event beautifully illustrated how a few supposedly distinct types of curiosity, such as that evoked by novelty and the one representing the thirst for knowledge, can combine and feed each other to form one irresistible attraction. In March 1993, a previously unknown comet was spotted orbiting the planet Jupiter. The discoverers were veteran comet hunters, husband and wife astronomers Carolyn and Eugene Shoemaker and astronomer David Levy. Since that was the ninth periodic comet identified by this team, the object was named Shoemaker-Levy 9. A detailed analysis of the orbit suggested that the comet had probably been captured by Jupiter&#x2019;s gravity a few decades earlier, and during a catastrophically close approach in 1992, it broke up into pieces due to strong tidal (stretching) forces. Figure 1 presents an image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in May 1994, showing the resulting two dozen or so fragments as they continued their course along the comet&#x2019;s path like a string of shining pearls.<br> <br> <br>Figure 1<br><br>Excitement in the astronomical world and beyond started to rise when computer simulations indicated that the fragments were likely to collide with Jupiter&#x2019;s atmosphere and to plow into it in July 1994. Such collisions are relatively rare (although one such impact on the Earth some 66 million years ago proved to be extremely unfortunate for the dinosaurs) and none had previously been directly witnessed. Astronomers all across the globe were waiting in eager anticipation. Nobody knew, however, if the effects of the impact would actually be visible from Earth or whether the fragments would simply be serenely swallowed by Jupiter&#x2019;s gaseous atmosphere like tiny pebbles by a large, undisturbed pond.<br> <br>The first icy chunk was expected to hit on the evening of July 16, 1994, and almost every telescope on the ground and in space, including Hubble, was directed at Jupiter. The fact that dramatic astronomical phenomena can seldom be observed in real time (it takes light many years to get to Earth from numerous objects of interest, but only about half an hour from Jupiter) gave this event a &#x201c;once in a lifetime&#x201d; feel. Not surprisingly, therefore, a group of scientists, myself included, gathered around a computer screen as the data were about to be transmitted down from the telescope (Figure 2). The question on everybody&#x2019;s mind was: Would we see anything?<br> <br> <br>Figure 2<br><br>If I had to give a title to Figure 2, I know exactly what it would be: Curiosity! To feel curiosity&#x2019;s contagious appeal, all you need to do is examine the posture and facial expressions of the scientists involved. As soon as I saw this photo on the following day, it reminded me of an extraordinary work of art executed almost four hundred years earlier; Rembrandt&#x2019;s The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp (Figure 3). The painting and the photograph are almost identical in how they capture the emotion of impassioned curiosity. What I find especially fascinating is the fact that Rembrandt&#x2019;s focus is neither on the anatomy of the flayed corpse being dissected (though the muscles and tendons are quite accurately depicted), nor even on the identity of the dead man (a young coat thief named Aris Kindt, hanged in 1632), whose face is partially shaded. Rather, Rembrandt was primarily interested in accurately expressing the individual reactions of each of the medical professionals and apprentices attending the lesson. He put curiosity at center stage.<br> <br> <br>Figure 3<br><br>Curiosity&#x2019;s powers extend above and beyond its perceived potential contributions to usefulness or benefits. It has shown itself to be an unstoppable drive. The efforts humans have invested, for instance, in exploring and attempting to decipher the world around them, have always far exceeded those needed for mere survival. It seems that we are an endlessly curious species, some of us even compulsively so. University of Southern California neuroscientist Irving Biederman says human beings are designed to be &#x201c;infovores,&#x201d; creatures that devour information. How else would you explain the risks people sometimes take to scratch that curiosity itch? The great Roman orator and philosopher Cicero interpreted Ulysses&#x2019;s sailing past the island of the Sirens as an effort to resist epistemic curiosity&#x2019;s lure: &#x201c;It was not the sweetness of their voices, nor the novelty and diversity of their songs, but their professions of knowledge that used to attract the passing voyagers; it was the passion for learning that kept men rooted to the Sirens&#x2019; rocky shores.&#x201d;<br> <br>French philosopher Michel Foucault beautifully describes a few of curiosity&#x2019;s inherent characteristics: &#x201c;Curiosity evokes &#x2018;care&#x2019;; it evokes the care one takes of what exists and what might exist; a sharpened sense of reality, but one that is never immobilized before it; a readiness to find what surrounds us strange and odd; a certain determination to throw off familiar ways of thought and to look at the same things in a different way; a passion for seizing what is happening now and what is disappearing; a lack of respect for the traditional hierarchies of what is important and fundamental.&#x201d;<br> <br>As we shall see, modern research suggests that curiosity may be essential for the proper development of perceptual and cognitive skills ...</p><h2>The Humongous Book of Algebra Problems (Humongous Books)</h2><p><b>When the numbers just don&#x2019;t add up...</b><br><br> Following in the footsteps of the successful <i>The Humongous Books of Calculus Problems</i>, bestselling author Michael Kelley has taken a typical algebra workbook, and made notes in the margins, adding missing steps and simplifying concepts and solutions.

Part Two examines how Vienna&#39;s coffeehouses, theaters, and concert halls stimulated creativity together with complacency. Part Three explores the fin-de-siecle world view known as Viennese Impressionism. Interacting with positivistic science, this reverence for the ephemeral inspired such pioneers ad Mach, Wittgenstein, Buber, and Freud. Part Four describes the vision of an ordered cosmos which flourished among Germans in Bohemia. Their philosophers cultivated a Leibnizian faith whose eventual collapse haunted Kafka and Mahler.

It has been developed in response to the need for a text that supports the mastery of this difficult subject. Therefore, in addition to presenting electromagnetics in a concise and logical manner, the text includes end-of-section review questions, worked examples, boxed remarks that alert students to key ideas and tricky points, margin notes, and point-by-point chapter summaries. Examples and applications invite students to solve problems and build their knowledge of electromagnetics. Application topics include: electric motors, transmission lines, waveguides, antenna arrays and radar systems.</p><p><p>This book is designed for use as an undergraduate text on engineering electromagnetics. Electromagnetics is one of the most fundamental subjects in an electrical engineering curriculum. Knowledge of the laws governing electric and magnetic fields is essential to the understanding of the principle of operation of electric and magnetic instruments and machines, and mastery of the basic theory of electromagnetic waves is indispensable to explaining action-at-a-distance electromagnetic phenomena and systems. </p><p>Because most electromagnetic variables are functions of three-dimensional space coordinates as well as of time, the subject matter is inherently more involved than electric circuit theory, and an adequate coverage normally requires a sequence of two semester-courses, or three courses in a quarter system. However, some electrical engineering curricula do not schedule that much time for electromagnetics. The purpose of this book is to meet the demand for a textbook that not only presents the fundamentals of electromagnetism in a concise and logical manner, but also includes important engineering application topics such as electric motors, transmission lines, waveguides, antennas, antenna arrays, and radar systems. </p><p>I feel that one of the basic difficulties that students have in learning electromagenetics is their failure to grasp the concept of an electromagnetic model. The traditional inductive approach of starting with experimental laws and gradually synthesizing them into Maxwell's equations tends to be fragmented and incohesive; and the introduction of gradient, divergence e, and curl operations appears to be ad hoc and arbitrary. On the other hand, the extreme of starting with the entire set of Maxwell's equations, which are of considerable complexity, as fundamental postulates is likely to cause consternation and resistance in students at the outset. The question of the necessity and sufficiency of these general equations is not addressed, and the concept of the electromagnetic model is left vague. </p><p>This book builds the electromagnetic model using an axiomatic approach in steps--first for static electric fields, then for static magnetic fields, and finally for time-varying fields leading to Maxwell's equations. The mathematical basis for each step is Helmholtz's theorem, which states that a vector field is determined to within an additive constant if both its divergence and its curl are specified everywhere. A physical justification of this theorem may be based on the fact that the divergence of a vector field is a measure of the strength of its flow source and the curl of the field is a measure of strength of its vortex source. When the strengths of both the flow source and the vortex source are specified, the vector field is determined. </p><p>For the development of the electrostatic model in free space, it is only necessary to define a single vector (namely, the electric field intensity E) by specifying its divergence and its curl as postulates. All other relations in electrostatics for free space, including Coulomb's law and Gauss's law, can be derived from the two rather simple postulates. Relations in material media can be developed through the concept of equivalent charge distributions of polarized dielectrics. </p><p>Similarly, for the magnetostatic model in free space it is necessary to define only a single magnetic flux density vector B by specifying its divergence and its curl as postulates; all other formulas can be derived from these two postulates. Relations in material media can be developed through the concept of equivalent current densities. Of course, the validity of the postulates lies in their ability to yield results that conform with experimental evidence. </p><p>For time-varying fields, the electric and magnetic field intensities are coupled. The curl E postulate for the electrostatic model must be modified to conform with Faraday's law. In addition, the curl B postulate for the magnetostatic model must also be modified in order to be consistent with the equation of continuity. We have, then, the four Maxwell's equations that constitute the electromagnetic model. I believe that this gradual development of the electromagnetic model based on Helmholtz's theorem is novel, systematic, pedagogically sound, and more easily accepted by students. </p><p>A short Chapter 1 of the book provides some motivations for the study of electromagnetism. It also introduces the source functions, the fundamental field quantities, and the three universal constants for free space in the electromagnetic model. Chapter 2 reviews the basics of vector algebra, vector calculus, and the relations of Cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical coordinate systems. Chapter 3 develops the governing laws and methods of solution of electrostatic problems. Chapter 4 is on steady electric current fields and resistance calculations. Chapter 5 deals with static magnetic fields. Chapter 6, on time-varying electromagnetic fields, starts with Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, and leads to Maxwell's equations and wave equations. The characteristics of plane electromagnetic waves are treated in Chapter 7. The theory and application s of transmission lines are studied in Chapter 8. Further engineering applications of electromagnetic fields and waves are discussed in Chapter 9 (waveguides and cavity resonators) and Chapter 10 (antennas, antenna arrays, and radar systems). Much of the material has been adapted and reduced from my larger book, Field and Wave Electromagnetics, but in this book I have incorporated a number of innovative pedagogical features. </p><p>Each chapter of this book starts with an overview section that provides qualitative guidance to the topics to be discussed in the chapter. Throughout the book worked-out examples follow important formulas and quantitative relations to illustrate methods for solving typical problems. Where appropriate, simple exercises with answers are included to test students' ability to handle related situations. At irregular intervals, a group of review questions are inserted after several related sections. These questions serve to provide an immediate feedback of the topics just discussed and to reinforce students' qualitative understanding of the material. Also, a number of pertinent remarks usually follow the review questions. These remarks contain some points of special importance that the students may have overlooked. When new definitions, concepts, or relations are introduced, short notes are added in the margins to emphasize their significance. At the end of each chapter there is a summary with bulleted items summarizing the main topics covered in the chapter. I hope that these pedagogical aids will prove to be useful in helping students learn electromagentics and its applications. </p><p>Many dedicated people, besides the author, are involved in the publication of a book such as this one. I wish to acknowledge the interest and support of Senior Editor Eileen Bernadette Moran and Executive Editor Don Fowley since the inception of this project. I also wish to express my appreciation to Production Supervisor Helen Wythe for her friendly assistance in keeping the production on schedule, as well as to Roberta Lewis, Amy Willcutt, Laura Michaels, and Alena Konecny for their contributions. Jim and Rosa Sullivan of Tech-Graphics were responsible for the illustrations. To them I offer my appreciation for their fine work. Above all, I wish to thank my wife, Enid, for her patience, understanding and encouragement through all phases of my challenging task of completing this book. </p><p>D.K.C.</p><p> <i>Fundamental of Engineering Electromagnetics</i> not only presents the fundamentals of electromagnetism in a concise and logical manner, but also includes a variety of interesting and important applications.

At the time, Watson was only twenty-four, a young scientist hungry to make his mark. His uncompromisingly honest account of the heady days of their thrilling sprint against other world-class researchers to solve one of science&#x2019;s greatest mysteries gives a dazzlingly clear picture of a world of brilliant scientists with great gifts, very human ambitions, and bitter rivalries. <br> <br>With humility unspoiled by false modesty, Watson relates his and Crick&#x2019;s desperate efforts to beat Linus Pauling to the Holy Grail of life sciences, the identification of the basic building block of life. Never has a scientist been so truthful in capturing in words the flavor of his work.</p><p>"Science seldom proceeds in the straightforward logical manner imagined by outsiders," writes James Watson in <i>The Double Helix</i>, his account of his codiscovery (along with Francis Crick) of the structure of DNA. Watson and Crick won Nobel Prizes for their work, and their names are memorized by biology students around the world. But as in all of history, the real story behind the deceptively simple outcome was messy, intense, and sometimes truly hilarious. To preserve the "real" story for the world, James Watson attempted to record his first impressions as soon after the events of 1951-1953 as possible, with all their unpleasant realities and "spirit of adventure" intact.<p> Watson holds nothing back when revealing the petty sniping and backbiting among his colleagues, while acknowledging that he himself was a willing participant in the melodrama. In particular, Watson reveals his mixed feelings about his famous colleague in discovery, Francis Crick, who many thought of as an arrogant man who talked too much, and whose brilliance was appreciated by few. This is the joy of <i>The Double Helix</i>--instead of a chronicle of stainless-steel heroes toiling away in their sparkling labs, Watson's chronicle gives readers an idea of what living science is like, warts and all. <i>The Double Helix</i> is a startling window into the scientific method, full of insight and wit, and packed with the kind of science anecdotes that are told and retold in the halls of universities and laboratories everywhere. It's the stuff of legends. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p>Since its publication in 1968, &#39;The Double Helix&#39; has given over a million readers a rare and exciting look at one highly significant piece of scientific research--Watson and Crick&#39;s race to discover the molecular structure of the gene. In this critical edition, Watson&#39;s lively and irreverent account is placed in historical perspective by Gunther Stent&#39;s introduction and by retrospective views from two major figures in the adventure, Francis Crick and Linus Pauling, and by Rosalind Franklin&#39;s last student, Aaron Klug.</p><h2>Texas Bug Book: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</h2><p>Honeybees in the flowers, fire ants in the yard, roaches in the kitchen--the good, the bad, and the ugly bugs are all over Texas!

This title introduces the formal elements and production process of films, and helps students analytically view and understand films within their historical, cultural and social contexts. The text presents an analytical framework that can be applied to all movies, as distinctly different as Avatar, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Vertigo, Iron-Man, Man on Wire, and The Hurt Locker.</p></p><p></p><h2>Tipping the Velvet: A Novel</h2><p>Chronicles the picaresque adventures and romantic misadventures of Nan King, a one-time oyster girl from a provincial seaside town, through the gay and lesbian world of late Victorian England. A first novel. 15,000 first printing.</p><p>The heroine of Sarah Waters's audacious first novel knows her destiny, and seems content with it. Her place is in her father's seaside restaurant, shucking shellfish and stirring soup, singing all the while. "Although I didn't long believe the story told to me by Mother--that they had found me as a baby in an oyster-shell, and a greedy customer had almost eaten me for lunch--for eighteen years I never doubted my own oysterish sympathies, never looked far beyond my father's kitchen for occupation, or for love." At night Nancy Astley often ventures to the nearby music hall, not that she has illusions of being more than an audience member. But the moment she spies a new male impersonator--still something of a curiosity in England circa 1888--her years of innocence come to an end and a life of transformations begins.<p> <i>Tipping the Velvet</i>, all 472 pages of it, is as saucy, as tantalizing, and as touching as the narrator's first encounter with the seductive but shame-ridden Miss Kitty Butler. And at first even Nancy's family is thrilled with her gender-bending pal, all but her sister, best friend, and bedmate, Alice, "her eyes shining cold and dull, with starlight and suspicion." Not to worry. Soon Nancy and Kitty are off to London, their relationship close though (alas for our heroine) sisterly. We know that bliss will come, and it does, in an exceptionally charged moment. A lesser author would have been content to stop her story there, but Waters has much more in mind for her buttonholing heroine, and for us. In brief, her Everywoman with a sexual difference goes from success onstage to heartbreak to a stint as a male prostitute (necessity truly <i>is</i> the mother of invention) to keeping house for a brother and sister in the Labour movement. And did I mention her long stint as a plaything in the pleasure palace of a rich Sapphist extraordinaire? Diana Lethaby is as cruel as she is carnal, and even the well-concealed Cavendish Ladies' Club isn't <i>outr�</i> enough for her. Kitting Nancy out in full, elegant drag, she dares the front desk to turn them away. "We are here," she mocks, "for the sake of the irregular." </p><p> Only after some seven years of hard twists and sensual turns does Nancy conclude that a life of sensation is not enough. Still, <i>Tipping the Velvet</i> is so entertaining that readers will wish her sentimental--and hedonistic--education had taken twice as long. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p><p> <b><b>Sarah Waters</b>&nbsp;</b>is the<i> New York Times</i> bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>The Little Stranger</i>, <i>The Night Watch</i>, <i>Fingersmith</i>,<i> </i><i>Affinity, </i>and <i>Tipping the Velvet.</i>&nbsp;She&nbsp;has three times been short-listed for the Man Booker Prize, twice been a finalist for the Orange Prize, and was&nbsp;named one of&nbsp;<i>Granta</i>&#x2019;s best&nbsp;young British&nbsp;novelists, among other distinctions.

These questions can be answered for the proposed text only in the context of recommendations that have been made as the result of a 1984 conference on the statistical education of engineers Hogg(1985) and a 1993 Quality Engineering Workshop Hogg(1994). Among the recommendations made was that engineers need to appreciate the following statistical concepts: </p> <ol> <li>omnipresence of variability;</li> <li>the use of simple graphical tools such as run charts, histograms, scatter plots, probability plots, residual plots, and control charts;</li> <li>basic concepts of statistical inference;</li> <li>the importance and essentials of carefully planned design of experiments;</li> <li>the philosophies of Shewhart, Deming, and other practitioners concerning the quality of products and services.</li> </ol> <p> The Hogg(1994) article proposed a core course of topics for engineering students. This proposed text is based on the curriculum model presented in that article. </p> <p><b>Educational Philosophy</b></p> <p> In our many years of teaching introductory statistics courses to students majoring in a wide variety of disciplines, we have continually searched for ways to improve the teaching of these courses. Over the years, our vision has come to include the following: </p> <ol> <li>Students need a frame of reference when learning a subject, especially one that is not their major. This frame of reference for engineering and science students should be applications to the various areas of engineering and the sciences. The discussion of each statistical topic should include references to at least one of these areas of application.</li> <li>Virtually all the students taking introductory statistics courses for engineers and scientists are majoring in areas other than statistics. Introductory courses should, therefore, focus on the underlying principles that are important for nonstatistics majors.</li> <li>The use of spreadsheet and/or statistical software should be integrated into all aspects of the introductory statistics course. The reality that exists in the workplace is that spreadsheet software (and sometimes statistical software) is typically available on one's computer desktop. Our teaching approach needs to recognize this reality and make our courses more consistent with the workplace environment.</li> <li>Textbooks that use software must provide detailed instructions that maximizes the student's ability to use the software with a minimum risk of failure.</li> <li>Instruction for each topic should focus on (1) the application of the topic to an area of engineering or the sciences, (2) the interpretation of results, (3) the presentation of assumptions, (4) the evaluation of the assumptions, and (5) the discussion of what should be done if the assumptions are violated. These 'points are particularly important in regression, forecasting and in hypothesis testing. Although the illustration of some computations is inevitable, the focus on computations should be minimized.</li> <li>Both classroom examples and homework exercises should relate to actual or realistic data as much as possible. Introductory courses should avoid an over-concentration on one topic area and instead provide breadth of coverage of a variety of statistical topics. This will help students avoid the "I can't see the forest for the trees" syndrome.</li> </ol> <p> The main features of this proposed text are summarized in the following sections. </p> <p><b>Main Feature: Emphasis on Data Analysis and Interpretation of Computer Output</b></p> <p> The personal computer revolution has dramatically changed how information is analyzed in the workplace and how statistics should be taught in the classroom. In this text, we take the position that the use of computer software in the form of a spreadsheet application such as Microsoft Excel or a statistical package such as MINITAB is an integral part of learning statistics. We emphasize analyzing data, interpreting the output from Microsoft Excel and MINITAB, and explaining how to use this software while reducing the emphasis on computation. In order to carry out our approach, we have integrated this output into the fabric of the text. For example, our coverage of tables and charts in Chapter 2 focuses on the interpretation of various charts, not on their construction by hand. In Chapter 9 on hypothesis testing, we have made sure to include extensive computer output so that the <i>p</i>-value approach can be used. The presentation of simple linear regression in Chapter 12, assumes that software such as Microsoft Excel or MINITAB will be used, and thus our focus is on the interpretation of the output, not on hand calculations (which have been placed in a separate section of the chapter). </p> <p><b>Main Feature: Problems, Case Studies, and Team Projects</b></p> <p> "Learning" results from "doing." This text provides the student with the opportunity to select from many problems (most with multiple parts) presented at the ends of sections as well as at the ends of chapters. Most of these problems use real data and apply to realistic situations in various fields of engineering and the sciences. Students can aid their comprehension by engaging in multiple hands-on exercises as detailed below. </p> <ul> <li>The end-of-section problems give the students the opportunity to reinforce what they have just learned.</li> <li>The chapter review problems included at the end of each chapter are based on the concepts and methods learned throughout the chapter.</li> <li>Answers to Selected Odd-Numbered Problems appear at the end of the text.</li> <li>Detailed Case Studies are included at the end of several chapters.</li> <li>The <i>Whitney Gourmet Cat Food Company</i> case study is included at the end of most chapters, as an integrating theme.</li> </ul> <p><b>Main Feature: Appendices on Using Microsoft Excel and MINITAB</b></p> <p> Rather than rely on the supplementary manuals, that accompany statistical software packages, it is a much better pedagogical approach to provide an explanation of how the software is used in the text while employing the in-chapter examples. Detailed appendices are included at the end of all chapters that explain how to use MINITAB, the most popular statistical software for introductory business statistics, and Microsoft Excel, the dominant spreadsheet package. In addition, an appendix is provided after Chapter 1 that explains the basics of the Windows operating environment. </p> <p><b>Main Feature: Statistics Add-In for Microsoft Excel&#x2014;PHStat</b></p> <p> The CD-ROM that accompanies the text includes the PHStat Statistics add-in for Microsoft Excel that facilitates its use in introductory statistics courses. Although Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet package, it contains features that enable it to perform statistical analysis for many of the topics in this text. In some cases, however, such analyses are cumbersome in the off-the-shelf version of Microsoft Excel. The PHStat statistics add-in provides a custom menu of choices that leads to dialog boxes which enable users to make entries and selections to perform specific analyses. PHStat minimizes the work associated with setting up statistical solutions in Microsoft Excel by automating the creation of spreadsheets and charts. PHStat, along with Microsoft Excel's Data Analysis tool, now allows users to perform statistical analyses on virtually all topics covered in this text. </p> <p><b>Main Feature: Pedagogical Aids</b></p> <p> Numerous features designed to create a more stimulating learning environment throughout the text include: </p> <ul> <li>conversational writing style;</li> <li>a <i>Using Statistics</i> example that illustrates the application of at least one of the statistical methods covered in each chapter in engineering and the sciences;</li> <li>real data for many of the examples and problems;</li> <li>exhibit boxes that highlight important concepts;</li> <li>comment boxes that focus on assumptions of statistical methods;</li> <li>problem sets with varied levels of difficulty and complexity;</li> <li>key terms;</li> <li>chapter opening quotes from a philosopher, historical figure, well-known statistician or from literature;</li> <li>chapter ending problems that begin with <i>Checking Your Understanding</i> problems that require students to demonstrate their understanding of concepts;</li> <li>explanation and illustration of statistical tables;</li> <li>side notes in which additional material appears adjacent to where it is referenced.</li> </ul> <p><b>Main Feature: Statistical Topics Covered</b></p> <p> The text focuses on such topics as tables and charts (Chapter 2), descriptive statistics (Chapter 3), control charts (Chapters 6 and 7), experimental design (Chapters 10 and 11), regression (Chapters 12 and 13), and statistical inference (Chapters 8 and 9). This emphasis is consistent with the recommendations presented by Hogg(1994). </p> <p> Perhaps the important statistical method used by engineers in industry is experimental design. Simply stated, engineers need to know how to conduct experiments where multiple factors are varied. Thus, in addition to coverage of one- and two-factor designs, this text discusses the concept of interaction in depth. Further, it provides coverage of factorial and fractional-factorial designs, using both a graphical approach and a confirmatory hypothesis-testing approach. In addition, the contributions of the Japanese engineer Genichi Taguchi are introduced. </p> <p> By providing this comprehensive coverage of quality and experimental design, the text provides an orientation that allows the presentation of statistical tools in an organizational context, instead of in isolation. The goal is for students to learn not just how to use the tools but why and how statistical methods are useful in a wide variety of industrial settings. A portion of Chapter 1 is devoted to quality management, including both key themes and the contribution of individuals such as W Edwards Deming, Joseph Juran, and Walter Shewhart. </p> <p><b>Main Feature: Full Supplement Package</b></p> <p> The supplement package that accompanies this text includes: </p> <ul> <li> <b>Instructor's Solution Manual</b>&#x2014;written by M&amp;N Toscano. This solutions manual is enriched with extra detail in the problem solutions and many Excel solutions. ISBN 0-13027423-2.</li> <li> <b>Student Solutions Manual</b>&#x2014;written by M&amp;N Toscano.

Presented in House&#x2019;s honest, authentic, and often irreverent style, and covering topics ranging from fonts and fashion to ceramics and space technology, this beautifully useful 400&#x2013;page volume offers a personal perspective on the origin of ideas for creative people in any field. Most important, this book shows that there&#x2019;s no sense in waiting for inspiration because inspiration is already waiting for you.</p><p>Known throughout the world for its eclectic font collections and far-reaching creative exploits, House Industries has been a standard bearer for American graphic design for 25 years. House&#x2019;s work is in the permanent collection of the Smithsonian&#x2019;s Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum and will be the subject of a major exhibition at the Henry Ford Museum in the summer of 2017.<b>INTRO&nbsp;</b><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Where do you find inspiration?&#x201d; We get asked that a lot. Honestly, we&nbsp;never really thought about it much; we just made things up as we went&nbsp;along, relying on our instincts and intuition. But when the opportunity&nbsp;to write this book came along, we decided it was time to give the question&nbsp;a little more consideration and try to answer it. So we played the last twenty-five years backwards and deconstructed our work, figuring&nbsp;if we were going to mow down enough trees for a couple hundred&nbsp;pages, we should cook up something a bit more meaningful than a&nbsp;simple monograph.<br><br>As convenient as it would be to trace our inspiration to a single&nbsp;source, we can&#x2019;t do that. What we do know is that inspiration can&#x2019;t be&nbsp;boiled down to one thing, be it a cool flea market find, an influential&nbsp;book, a personal hero, or a eureka moment. Our inspiration comes&nbsp;from a combination of factors&#x2014;elements that are already part of the&nbsp;way we look at things and, consequently, part of the way we work.&nbsp;When we took a closer look at it, our process revealed itself as a mash&nbsp;up of personal interests, skills, working habits, relationships, and storytelling,&nbsp;not necessarily in that order.<br><br>Bring your hobbies to work. Sweat the technique. Get your hands&nbsp;dirty. Make friends. Tell it like it was. Embrace chaos. These chapter&nbsp;titles are short sentences, but at the same time, they are complete ideas&nbsp;that define the philosophy of our working process and form the core&nbsp;of this book. We illustrate each idea with case studies about specific&nbsp;projects, chronicling the backstories, artifacts, and memories that&nbsp;shaped them, warts and all. Each narrative shows how we applied&nbsp;these concepts so that you can benefit from our mistakes or maybe&nbsp;even steal a few ideas to spark inspiration in your own process.<br><br>We hope this book will help you navigate the tricky intersection&nbsp;between art and commerce in a way that satisfies the definitions of&nbsp;both&#x2014;quite simply by finding some creative fulfillment while paying&nbsp;the bills. There&#x2019;s an element of art in everything you do. To us, though,&nbsp;art itself is not the final product; art lies in the process of making that&nbsp;product. And that&#x2019;s where we find our inspiration.</p><h2>The Atlas of Ancient Rome: Biography and Portraits of the City - Two-volume slipcased set</h2><p><p><b>The most authoritative illustrated reference book on the urban history of ancient Rome</b></p><p><i>The Atlas of Ancient Rome</i> provides a comprehensive archaeological survey of the city of Rome from prehistory to the early medieval period.

Outstanding features include nearly 100,000 words and phrases, more than 160,000 usage examples, more than 22,000 idioms, verbal collocations, and commonly used phrases, and more than 1,000 original drawings--including 16 pages of full color art. Abundant supplemental information includes 25 pages of grammar.</p><p>Since 1937. Merriam-Webster is America&#39;s foremost publisher of language-related reference works. The company publishes a diverse array of print and electronic products, including Merriam-Webster&#39;s Collegiate� Dictionary, Eleventh Edition America&#39;s best-selling desk dictionary and Webster&#39;s Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged. Merriam-Webster can be considered the direct lexicographical heir of Noah Webster. In 1843, the company bought the rights to the 1841 edition of Webster&#39;s magnum opus, An American Dictionary of the English Language, Corrected and Enlarged. At the same time, they secured the rights to create revised editions of the work. Since that time, Merriam-Webster editors have carried forward Noah Webster&#39;s work, creating some of the most widely used and respected dictionaries and reference books in the world.This is the first foray for any dictionary publisher in the U.S. into territory already covered by most of the major dictionary publishers.&nbsp;The new Merriam-Webster&nbsp;ESL dictionary&nbsp;is similar in format to the Oxford ESL Dictionary (2004), with black-and-blue print&#x2014;definitions in black, examples in blue. It is larger both in size and word count,&nbsp;with approximately 100,000 words and phrases. There are&nbsp;160,000 usage examples in addition to notes, drawings, and 16 pages of full-color art. British English definitions are included, but the emphasis is on American English, with a blue underline indicating 3,000 basic English words. The Merriam-Webster database of more than 100 million words was used to select words for inclusion,&nbsp;as were Internet sources, particularly the Lexis-Nexis database.

The aggressive pursuit of heretics and attempts to control the &#x201c;Holy Land&#x201d; might come to mind. Yet the medieval world produced much that is part of our world today, including universities, the passion for Roman architecture and the development of the gothic style, pilgrimage, the emergence of capitalism, and female saints.<br> &nbsp;<br> This new narrative history of medieval Christianity, spanning the period 500 to 1500 CE, attempts to integrate what is familiar to readers with new themes and narratives. Elements of novelty in the book include a steady focus on the role of women in Christianity; the relationships among Christians, Jews, and Muslims; the experience of ordinary parishioners; the adventure of asceticism, devotion, and worship; and instruction through drama, architecture, and art. Madigan expertly integrates these areas of focus with more traditional themes, such as the evolution and decline of papal power; the nature and repression of heresy; sanctity and pilgrimage; the conciliar movement; and the break between the old Western church and its reformers.<br> &nbsp;<br> Illustrated with more than forty photographs of physical remains, this book promises to become an essential guide to a historical era of profound influence.<br></p><p><b>Kevin Madigan</b> is Winn Professor of Ecclesiastical History at Harvard Divinity School.

With 75 well-tested recipes authorized by Instant Pot covering every meal of the day, this is a go-to resource for classic chicken, lamb, and vegetarian curries; daals, soups, and seafood like fennel and saffron spiced mussels; breakfast delights like spicy frittata and ginger almond oatmeal; and sweet treats like rose milk cake and fig and walnut halwa.</p><p>ARCHANA MUNDHE is a software engineer turned recipe developer, cooking instructor, and food blogger who writes at <i>Ministry of Curry</i>. Born and raised in western India, Mundhe now cooks and writes in New Jersey, where she lives with her husband and their two sons.INTRODUCTION&nbsp;<br><br> Growing up in India, cooking appliances were very limited, but the one thing that was an absolute must in every kitchen across the country was a stove-top pressure cooker. The sound of the pressure building and releasing, better known as &#x201c;the whistle,&#x201d; could be heard in every home before meals. My mom would have me sit in the kitchen and count whistles. I would wait for two or three, depending on what she was making, and then call for her to come turn off the stove. However, I was never allowed to go near the cooker or touch it out of fear of getting burned. When I discovered the Instant Pot a few years ago, it was a mealtime game changer. This truly &#x201c;smart&#x201d; pressure cooker with several built-in functions and safety features literally took the pressure off me while I cooked in my New Jersey kitchen with my young children. As a working parent, a major benefit of pressure cooking is that you can produce a nutritious, flavorful hot meal in less than an hour&#x2014;and there is only one pot to clean!<br><br>The word &#x201c;instant&#x201d; in Instant Pot could be misleading for some because it doesn&#x2019;t speed up the cooking time for all foods. For me, the key difference of cooking in the Instant Pot rather than on the stove is that the Instant Pot makes the process more hands-off, especially for Indian cooking. It is a true one-pot experience where you can cook traditional recipes like biryani, pongal, korma, and other dishes that would normally use multiple pots. More than fifty of the recipes in this book are adaptations of my family&#x2019;s traditional recipes from the regions of Maharashtra and Gujarat in western India. Most of the North and South Indian recipes in these pages are popular dishes that I grew up eating in my hometown near Bombay (now Mumbai). In all cases, I&#x2019;ve simplified the original recipes, using modern techniques to adapt them to the Instant Pot while preserving the authentic flavors.<br><br>The Instant Pot is designed with several smart presets, which help achieve consistent cooking. Once you know the cooking time for a specific ingredient, it is easy to use the same setting when using that ingredient to make a different dish. This consistency makes it easy for you to experiment with your own recipes!<br><br>The Pressure Cook or Manual setting can be used to set custom times, which you&#x2019;ll be using with these recipes. In the DUO model, the pressure can be adjusted to high or low, making it a perfect option for cooking dishes like rice, chicken, lentils, and fish with variable cooking times.&nbsp;<br><br>The Saut� setting is crucial, especially for traditional Indian recipes. I start most of my recipes by making a tadka, or saut�ing onion, ginger, garlic, and spices in hot oil or ghee. This key step releases the flavors of these ingredients while creating a base for the dish. The Saut� setting is followed by a pressure-cooking cycle that seals the flavors into the remaining ingredients of the dish. When finishing curries, Saut� can be used to bring the dish to the right consistency.<br><br>My goal for this cookbook, which is my dream realized, is to help both expert and novice cooks easily achieve authentic flavor with this modern-day method. These tried-and-true tested recipes aim to make home-cooked Indian cuisine attainable for all.</p><h2>School for Love (New York Review Books Classics)</h2><p>Jerusalem in 1945 is a city in flux: refugees from the war in Europe fill its streets and caf�s, the British colonial mandate is coming to an end, and tensions are on the rise between the Arab and Jewish populations. Felix Latimer, a recently orphaned teenager, arrives in Jerusalem from Baghdad, biding time until he can secure passage to England. Adrift and deeply lonely, Felix has no choice but to room in a boardinghouse run by Miss Bohun, a relative he has never met. Miss Bohun is a holy terror, a cheerless miser who proclaims the ideals of a fundamentalist group known as the Ever-Readies&#x2014;joy, charity, and love&#x2014;even as she makes life a misery for her boarders.

Burton (The Squatter and the Don) was a Baja California native who married a colonel in the Union Army, and here she combines to good effect both solid insider information and her perspective as an outsider. Dr. Norval returns to New England from a trip west carrying more than luggage. While in an Indian camp, Norval rescued a ten-year-old girl, whose mother was a kidnapped Mexican woman desperate to return Lola to the girl's father. Lola is scorned both by the local gentry, who believe she is either black or Indian, and by the doctor's wife?at least until Dr. Norval reveals that she was accompanied by a lot of gold. When word of her wealth gets out, Lola is treated like a lady as the townspeople begin complex plans to get close to her and her money. The details are exquisite. Burton excels at picking names for these supposedly good Christians, from Mrs. Cackle to the Reverends Hackwell and Hammerhard. In short chapters with titles like "Potations, Plotting and Propriety," Burton details the intricate mess of love and proposals?both honest and contrived. A thorough introduction traces specific themes like the novel's precocious portrayal of women entering the public sphere, and footnotes lend helpful historical background. In the end it is the story that counts, though, and this is a fully entertaining read that stands on its own against much of today's fiction. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Oxygen: The Molecule that Made the World</h2><p>Three hundred million years ago, dragonflies grew as big as seagulls, with wingspans nearly a yard across. Researchers claim they could have flown only if the air had contained more oxygen than today-probably as much as 35 per cent. But oxygen is a toxic gas. Fruit flies raised at twice the normal level of oxygen live half as long as their siblings. If atmospheric oxygen reached 35 per cent in the Carboniferous, why did oxygen promote exuberant growth, instead of rapid aging and death?<br> This is just one of the puzzles Nick Lane answers in <em>Oxygen</em>. Lane takes the reader on an enthralling journey, as gripping as a thriller, as he unravels the unexpected ways in which oxygen spurred the evolution of life and death. The book explains far more than the size of ancient insects: it shows how oxygen underpins the origin of biological complexity, the birth of photosynthesis, the sudden evolution of animals, the need for two sexes, the accelerated aging of cloned animals like Dolly the sheep, and the surprisingly long lives of bats and birds. Drawing on this grand evolutionary canvas, Oxygen offers fresh perspectives on our own lives and deaths, explaining modern killer diseases, why we age, and what we can do about it. <br> Advancing revelatory new ideas, following chains of evidence, the book ranges through many disciplines, from environmental sciences to molecular medicine. The result is a captivating vision of contemporary science and a humane synthesis of our place in nature. This remarkable book will redefine the way we think about the world.</p><p><br><strong>Nick Lane</strong> is an honorary research fellow at University College London and strategic director at Adelphi MediCine, a medical multimedia company based in London. His writings have appeared in numerous international journals, including <em>Scientific American, The Lancet</em>, and the <em>British Medical Journal</em>. He lives in London.<br>Nick Lane, the author of Oxygen, studied biochemistry at the University of London and did his doctoral research on oxygen free radicals at the Royal Free Hospital in London, but then left science to become the director of a multimedia company involved to a certain extent in medical education. His background suffuses this book, both for better and for worse. Apart from the first chapter, which is cast in a style approaching the juvenile, the book is very well written and easy to read. Lane makes his points clearly, and his lines of reasoning are well developed. The first half of the book is a very interesting and well-thought-out analysis of evolution, starting from the Archean eon and carrying on through the appearance of multicellular eukaryotes, such as humans. There is some awkward writing: "oxygen-hating" this and that, "first ever ice age," and a strained analogy about opinionated newspaper proprietors. Early in the book there are three or four statements that look like errors, but they are corrected later in the book. Of considerable interest, however, are Lane's remarks about chlorophyll arising from purple bacteria. Even more interesting is his comment to the effect that the oxygen-evolving complex in plants arose from an adaptation of catalase. He astutely points out that Fridovich's discovery of superoxide dismutase was "the most important discovery in modern biology never to win the Nobel Prize," a sentiment with which I heartily concur. The second half of the book begins with an excellent chapter on vitamin C, in which the author appropriately describes the outstanding work of Mark Levine and quotes Linus Pauling: "I would trust the biochemistry of a goat over the advice of a doctor." But subsequently, there is a mistake: Sue-Goo Rhee is referred to as a woman, when in fact he is a man. The rest of the second half, though informative in many places, is chiefly a buildup to the author's own theory -- namely, that aging itself is due exclusively to the damage caused by the leakage of oxygen radicals from aging mitochondria. In the course of the book, Lane takes a couple of shots at scientists for working on little pictures instead of the big picture. He takes little cognizance of the fact that big pictures, including the cause of aging, are made by the assembly of little pictures and that his own theory, probably only in part correct, was derived from many little pictures. He cites a few articles that support his idea but none that oppose it. Despite the inclusion of a small number of references, the book is not a perfect work of scholarship. But it is not meant to be one. It is a thought-provoking popularization of evolution and oxygen biochemistry, and I'm glad I read it. Its shortcomings notwithstanding, I can recommend the book strongly because of its informational content and its breezy and accessible style. It has to be read, though, with eyes open. <i>Bernard M.

For more than thirty years she worked with Hearst in a rare collaboration, creating not only his art-filled hilltop palace but also a fairytale Bavarian "village" known as Wyntoon and many other commercial and domestic structures. Yet the Hearst commissions, notable as they are, are not Morgan's only claim to fame.<br> <br>Given the sweep of Morgan's accomplishments, it is astonishing that this is the first substantial book ever devoted to her career. Painstakingly researched for more than a decade by Sarah Holmes Boutelle, founder of the Julia Morgan Association, this handsome volume lovingly document's Morgan's life and work. This is a remarkable book celebrating the achievements of a remarkable woman.<br></p><p>From her first reluctant visit to San Simeon in 1972, <b>Sara Holmes Boutelle</b> has been captivated by the diverse architecture and groundbreaking career of Julia Morgan. A graduate of Mount Holyoke, the Sorbonne, and Hamburg University, Ms. Boutelle taught art and architectural history for many years at the Brearley School in New York. A member of the Historic Preservation Commission in Santa Cruz, California, she has devoted almost fourteen years to researching, writing, and lecturing on Julia Morgan.<br><b>INTRODUCTION</b> <br> <br>The eye-dazzling theatricality of Hearst&#x2019;s famous castle, perched on a hilltop midway between San Francisco and Los Angeles, attracts a million or so curious visitors each year. The saga of this glamorous estate has become a familiar part of American lore, along with countless anecdotes about the mercurial man who commissioned it. But among the crowds of marveling visitors, only a handful can identify Julia Morgan as the architect who designed and built this extravagantly beautiful showplace. That she continued to work on it for more than twenty years, king the four-hundred-mile round trip by train and taxi nearly every weekend while maintaining a thriving practice in San Francisco, exemplifies her dauntless commitment to the project, to her career, and to architecture.<br> <br>Julia Morgan (1872 1957) stood just five feet tall and weighed about one hundred pounds. Her frail appearance belied her inexhaustible strength and iron will. Wearing tailored suits and French silk blouses, she clambered over scaffolds and descended into trenches to make sure that the walls and drains met her high standards. The head of a busy, prosperous practice, she worked quietly and alone, with no sounding board in the form of a close colleague or mate. Devoted to her career, she seems never even to have considered marriage, although she had many friends among her fellow students, clients, and colleagues and is remembered with affectionate respect by the surviving members of her staff.<br> <br>Over the course of her forty-seven-year career, Morgan designed upwards of seven hundred buildings, of which all but a small minority were built. She worked for institutions and individuals with equal ease, creating school, churches, stores, YWCAs, hospitals, houses, apartments, and a hay barn or two not to mention the theaters, bowling alley, billiard rooms, and zoo she built for William Randolph Hearst. Morgan had a special knack for swimming pools, using color, light, and shape to create sumptuous designs that flaunted a hedonism startling for so modest an architect.<br> <br>Two opposing forces determined Morgan&#x2019;s approach to architecture. One was the stately classicism she learned at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, the other was the environment (both natural and man-made) of her native California. Having earned a degree in engineering from the University of California, Berkely the closest thing to architectural training then available on the West Coast she became the first woman admitted into the architectural program at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, long regarded as the world&#x2019;s foremost architectural school. Yet unlike most of her fellow students, even those who were later her colleagues and competitors on the West Coast, Morgan adhered to the Beaux-Arts style only when it suited her. The extensive range of historical styles she mastered at the Ecole enriched her design vocabulary so she could refer to the past with authority but without feeling bound to precedent. This was the heart of academic eclecticism, but the decision about how faithful to remain to the past was a difficult one that tripped up many other architects of the period. What held Morgan steady throughout her career was the balance she established between historicism on the one hand and the demands of client and site on the other.<br> <br>Julia Morgan was born in San Francisco, and her affection for the California landscape infused her work, influencing her choice of style, materials, and colors. Her mother&#x2019;s letters to her in Paris refer frequently to Morgan&#x2019;s love of the rocks, trees, fruits, and flowers of the California countryside. Having established her office in San Francisco, Morgan worked throughout the state, with occasional forays as far afield as Illinois, Utah, and Hawaii. She chose her styles carefully to relate to the site at hand: the light-filled, woodsy comfort of the Arts and Crafts style seemed well suited to the rolling hills of the Bay Area; the simplicity of the California missions offered inspiration for dwellings and courtyards in more arid landscapes; buildings in the Bavarian style provided an apt choice for the snowy mountains of Tahoe and Shasta.<br> <br>It is difficult to trace any clear-cut development in Morgan&#x2019;s work. A strict chronology offers little help since some of her commissions stretched out over ten or more years and were designed concurrently with other buildings of very different types. Classifying her buildings by the materials and methods of their construction is equally unilluminating since those elements were interpreted differently from project to project. Morgan used reinforced concrete early and often, producing the first house ever built of that material in Berkeley, in 1906. Redwood was the cheapest and most readily available material during her early years of practice, but it lost favor after serious fires such as the one in Berkeley in 1923 (she nevertheless continued to use wood as late as 1939). Stucco and half-timber was a combination popular during the 1920s, and brick was also favored, especially by clients eager to create an impressive appearance and willing to risk brick&#x2019;s instability in an earthquake.<br> <br>The Arts and Crafts movement exerted a deep influence on Morgan. Begun by John Ruskin and William Morris as a reaction against the blight of industrialization in England, it quickly spread to America and soon made its way to the West Coast. The emphasis was on recapturing a simpler way of life, lived in harmony with nature. A building&#x2019;s materials were to come, if possible, from its own environment; simplicity and utility were the goals. Details were to be based on local traditions and natural sources, not pattern books. Architects associated with the movement worked with craftsmen, sculptors, and painters in a return to the collaborative ideals of the Middle Ages. They did not copy past styles but worked out free&#x201d; versions of them. No meaningless, ornamentation was permitted, and unpainted, unadorned materials were preferred, with construction elements left visible to reveal the highly skilled workmanship.<br> <br>The Arts and Crafts movement was brought to northern California by Joseph Worcester, a Swedenborgian minister and amateur builder who was influenced by Ruskin. In 1876 Worcester built a house of redwood shingles in Piedmont, across the bay from San Francisco. His use of unpainted redwood board for the interior and other radical departures from prevailing styles aroused the curiosity and enthusiasm of architects and artists throughout the Bay Area. Charles Keeler and Bernard Maybeck of Berkeley and Louis Christian Mullgardt, Willis Polk, and A.C. Schweinfurth of San Francisco formed the nucleus of a group that met during the late 1880s to discuss Crafts-related theories of design. For a short time in 1890 Polk put out a monthly journal, <i>Architectural News</i>, which propagated their ideas.<br> <br>In 1898 Keeler organized the Ruskin Club, which met in Schweinfurth&#x2019;s newly completed Unitarian Church in Berkeley. This small shingled structure with broad pitched roof has porches on two sides supported by unpeeled redwood trunks. A landmark example of Crafts architecture, it was the perfect setting for Keeler&#x2019;s club. That same year women activists founded the Hillside Club to protect the natural environment of the north Berkeley hills; members met at the Schweinfurth church and in various homes. Only women were allowed to belong until 1902, when the membership was opened to men, the most enthusiastic being Keeler and Maybeck, who designed a permanent clubhouse in 1906. Keeler&#x2019;s book <i>The Simple Home</i> (1904) apparently became a sort of bible for the group. The Hillside Club&#x2019;s most frequently quoted maxim was that a house was landscape gardening with a few rooms for use in case of rain.&#x201d; Unpainted wood was the material of choice for houses, inside and out (Maybeck&#x2019;s wife, Annie, called the few white-painted neighboring houses the beached ships&#x201d; of Berkeley).<br> <br>The moral fervor relating to nature extended to near fanaticism about health. Raising vegetables at home, maintaining a vegetarian diet, drinking coffee substitutes, taking ice-cold showers, sleeping in the open air (hence the need for sleeping porches&#x201d;), and pursing fitness through jogging, swimming, hiking, and dress reform all became part of the crusade. Julia Morgan knew that Maybecks and other members of the Hillside Club and shared many of their aesthetic ideas, if not the related moral commitments (she was reported by her wood-carver Jules Suppo to prefer lamb chops for dinner and to drink coffee morning and night).<br> <br>Morgan was the only prominent member of the group of architects interested in the Crafts movement who were born in California; the others all arrived as adults: Mullgardt from Saint Louis, Maybeck from New York, Ernest Coxed from England, Polk from Kansas City, and the Greene brothers from Ohio. Her own deep response to nature and to the local environment reinforced her interest in the Crafts principles of building simply and in harmony with the site. While she was in Paris, from 1896 to 1902, she had a subscription to <i>The Architect</i> magazine and also had access to British architectural periodicals, which must have familiarized her with what Morris&#x2019;s followers were doing. At the same time, her interest in medieval guilds, the Italian hill towns, and Eugene-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc&#x2019;s medievalism was as important a part of her education as the rational theory of the Beaux-Arts course. Thus, she was not unprepared for building in the Crafts tradition, although her engineering background and classical training made her aware how difficult it was to achieve a simple&#x201d; building.<br> <br>Much of Morgan&#x2019;s early domestic architecture reflected Crafts principles, as did such important structures as Saint John&#x2019;s Presbyterian Church in Berkeley (1908&amp;ndsah;1910) and the Asilomar YWCA Conference Center (c. 1913 1937). Morgan&#x2019;s buildings made a considerable contribution to the style, and it remained important to her philosophically long after a shortage of inexpensive wood and a change in fashion meant that she was generally building with concrete in Tudor, Mediterranean, or Bavarian styles.<br> <br>Morgan did not hesitate to apply Crafts principles to the interiors of Mediterranean buildings, large and small. She carried out those principles most dramatically in her work on the Hearst estate at San Simeon. There she presided over a kind of brotherhood of highly qualified artisans, including workers skilled in stone casting, ornamental plastering, wood carving (including John Klang, a specialist in creating wormholes and in matching new and old woods), and elaborate ironworking, as well as painters, weavers, tapestry workers, and tile designers. At San Simeon and in workshops in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Alameda, and Carmel, these specialists toiled for union wages (then two dollars an hour) to repair, copy, and add to the works of antiquity that Hearst kept buying so voraciously. They also improvised and designed, working from books and magazines borrow from Morgan&#x2019;s library and from photographs or sketches of buildings she had admired in Europe. Ed Trinkeller, an Alsatian ironworker, did caricatures and likenesses in iron. Camille Solon painted scenes and figures on the stone arches of the Gothic Study. Austro-Hungrarian Frank Gyorgy did antiquing in wood and metal. All followed Morgan&#x2019;s direction of careful carelessness.&#x201d; The ceilings, doors, windows, and furniture they created stand as significant Crafts works produced during a period when the movement was increasingly disregarded. Morgan brought many of these workers to Berkeley, to San Francisco, and to Wyntoon, and they all looked up to her, proud to be part of such a highly skilled group.<br></p><h2>The Sustainable Urban Development Reader (Routledge Urban Reader Series)</h2><p><p>Building on the success of its second edition, the third edition of the <em>Sustainable Urban Development Reader</em> provides a generous selection of classic and contemporary&nbsp; readings giving a broad introduction to this topic.&nbsp; It begins by tracing the roots of the sustainable development concept in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, before presenting readings on a number of dimensions of the sustainability concept.<br></p> <p>Topics covered include land use and urban design, transportation, ecological planning and restoration, energy and materials use, economic development, social and environmental justice, and green architecture and building.

Lee's army at Appomattox, Williamson Murray and Wayne Wei-siang Hsieh bring every aspect of the battlefield vividly to life. They show how this new way of waging war was made possible by the powerful historical forces unleashed by the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution, yet how the war was far from being simply a story of the triumph of superior machines. Despite the Union&#x2019;s material superiority, a Union victory remained in doubt for most of the war. Murray and Hsieh paint indelible portraits of Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, William Tecumseh Sherman, and other major figures whose leadership, judgment, and personal character played such decisive roles in the fate of a nation. They also examine how the Army of the Potomac, the Army of Northern Virginia, and the other major armies developed entirely different cultures that influenced the war&#x2019;s outcome.</p><p>A military history of breathtaking sweep and scope, <i>A Savage War</i> reveals how the Civil War ushered in the age of modern warfare.</p></p><p><p>"If you think that there is nothing new to write about the Civil War, this book will prove you wrong."<b>--H.

Structurally sound aircraft plummet to the earth, supertankers run aground in calm weather, and the machines of medical science maim unsuspecting patients - - all because designers sometimes fail to reflect the characteristics of the user in their designs. <p>Designers and the public alike are realizing that many human' errors are more aptly named designed-induced' errors. Most consumers experience the frustration of using many new products; amusing stories about programming a VCR, operating a personal computer, or finding the headlight switch on a rental car are heard in everyday conversation. The problems consumers experience with modern everyday things are shared by the users of large-scale technologies where the consequences of design can go well beyond simple matters of inconvenience or amusement. </p><p>In the new second edition of Set Phasers on Stun' and Other True Tales of Design, Technology, and Human Error, noted designer and author Steven Casey has assembled 20 factual and arresting stories about people and their attempts to use modern technological creations. Although the operator or pilot usually gets blamed for a big disaster, the root cause can frequently be found in subtle characteristics of the device's human interface.' Technological disasters can often be traced directly to the interplay between people and the design of a device - - be it an airliner cockpit, the controls in an industrial plant, a spacecraft's instruments, a medical system, a nuclear reactor, or even a commercial dishwashing machine. </p><p>The most effective way to convey the consequences of design-induced human error is with a good story and just the right level of technical detail, and this is what Casey has done in his new book. As stated by Alphonse Chapanis, one of the founders of the human factors engineering discipline, Set Phasers on Stun is A tour de force. A collection of gripping and often alarming true stories meticulously documented and skillfully told about design-induced human errors. It should be required reading for all engineers and designers, and everyone else concerned about the ways our modern technological creations can affect our everyday lives. Skylab-4 astronaut Gerald Carr agrees: The book is ...an engrossing tour through the world of human susceptibility to subtle variations in environment and in design.</p></p><p>In the new and expanded Second Edition of 'Set Phasers on Stun' and Other True Tales of Design, Technology, and Human Error, noted designer and author Steven Casey presents 20 factual and arresting stories about people and their attempts to use modern technological creations. Set Phasers on Stun demonstrates - - with shocking and graphic candor - - how technological failures result from the incompatibilities between the way things are designed and the way people actually perceive, think, and act. New technologies will succeed or fail based on our ability to minimize these incompatibilities between the characteristics of people and the characteristics of the things we create and use. <p>Two new chapters, as well as a new introduction, have been added to this Second Edition. In Murphy's Law and Newton's Law', listen in as a team of Swedish rocket technicians prepare to launch a payload into space above the arctic circle, and learn how the user interface on a simple device resulted in one of the most horrific but least publicized accidents in the history of rocketry. In The Price of the Amagasaki', accompany British Navy diver James Kull as he attempts a night-time attack on a Japanese warship off Singapore while using a new and poorly understood oxygen rebreather. Read the gripping stories of a tragic air show demonstration in France involving a new computer-controlled cockpit, the disaster of the supertanker Torrey Canyon, the human factors at play in the runaway chemical reaction that we have come to know as Bhopal, and, last but not least, Set Phasers on Stun, the tragic tale of a medical patient who meets his fate beneath a poorly designed radiotherapy machine in Texas. </p><p>From space above Russia, an island in the South Pacific, the hustle and bustle of Wall Street, remote Newfoundland, a bar in Topeka, northern Iraq, and the Pacific Northwest, Steven Casey lets the reader understand first hand how the combination of technology and human limitations can go wrong. </p><p>Set Phasers on Stun' and Other True Tales of Design, Technology, and Human Error affirms the harsh consequences of designing things that are incompatible with the characteristics of the people who will use them.</p>Steven M.

Her work with children includes nursery school, parent cooperatives, full-day child care, prekindergarten and bilingual preschools, and kindergarten and first grade. Kate's background in child development research led her to choose early childhood education. While a Head Teacher at Bing Nursery School and a lecturer with Stanford University, Kate developed a professional relationship with Ann Gordon that blossomed into work in teacher and parent education. Moreover, her role as a parent has influenced BEGINNINGS AND BEYOND: her two children were born during the first two editions, so the book grew along with them. Recent work as a consultant and public elementary school board trustee has offered Kate new perspectives on schools, reform, and collaboration. Working closely with her students while teaching in two community colleges over the last decade, she has gained constructive insights that inform this text in every revision."This is a very in-depth book that demonstrates how the NAEYC standards are related to the different areas we teach within the department. It has great pictures and the supplemental items associated with the book would make teaching the class easy and fun.

In the harbor town of Sulaco, a vivid cast of characters is caught up in a civil war to decide whether its fabulously wealthy silver mine, funded by American money but owned by a third-generation English immigrant, can be preserved from the hands of venal politicians. Greed and corruption seep into the lives of everyone, and Nostromo, the principled foreman of the mine, is tested to the limit.<br> Conrad's evocation of Latin America--its grand landscapes, the ferocity of its politics, and the tenacity of individuals swept up in imperial ambitions--has never been bettered.

Another is that ancient pre-occupation of poets&#x2013;&#x2013;the sense of the immediacy of death. Like Villon or Dylan Thomas, Corso lives close to the mystery of death. It is, perhaps, his central theme, on which variations ranging from the terrible to the comic are sounded. But Corso is seldom macabre. A bursting vitality always carries him back to the sensations of the living, though always it is the reality behind the obvious which has caught his eye. &#x201c;How I love to probe life,&#x201d; Corso has written, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what poetry is to me, a wondrous prober... It&#x2019;s not the metre or measure of a line, a breath; not &#x2018;law&#x2019; music; but the assembly of great eye sounds placed into an inspired measured idea.&#x201d;</p><p>Gregory Corso has been much publicized as one of the leading literary spokesmen for the &#39;Beat Generation, &#39; together with Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and William Burroughs.

Growing up in foster care and on the streets of Little Italy, Corso was a juvenile delinquent who spent time in Clinton Correctional Facility, in the cell recently vacated by gangster &#34;Lucky&#34; Luciano. An aspiring poet, Corso was taken under the wing of Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, and became the youngest member of the Beat Generation&#39;s inner circle, with whom he lived and work in the Beat Hotel, a lodging house in Paris, during the late fifties. There he created one of his signature works, &#34;Bomb&#34;, a poem composed of typewritten strips of paper arranged in the shape of a mushroom cloud. Late in life, Corso became reunited with his mother and maintained a close relationship with her until his death.</p><h2>Looking at Movies: An Introduction to Film, 4th Edition</h2><p><p><strong>Film analysis starts here.</strong></p><em>Looking at Movies</em> is the most effective introduction to film analysis available.

He was the originator of so many of the founding principles of American democracy. Politically, he shuffled off the centralized authority of the Federalists, working toward a more diffuse and minimalist leadership. He introduced the bills separating church and state and mandating free public education. He departed from the strict etiquette of his European counterparts, appearing at state dinners in casual attire and dispensing with hierarchical seating arrangements. Jefferson initiated the Lewis and Clark expedition and seized on the crucial moment when Napoleon decided to sell the Louisiana Territory, thus extending the national development. In this compelling examination, distinguished historian Joyce Appleby captures all of the richness of Jefferson's character and accomplishments.</p></p><p><b>Joyce Appleby</b> was a professor of history at UCLA. Specializing in the study of early America, she is the author of <i>Inheriting the Revolution: The First Generation of Americans</i> and <i>Liberalism and Republicanism in the Historical Imagination</i>.Thomas Jefferson, so multifaceted and long-lived, tries the skills of most who venture to write his biography, especially a short one like this. But UCLA historian Appleby (Inheriting the Revolution: The First Generation of Americans) has succeeded in writing as good a brief study of this complex man as is imaginable. Another in a series on the American chief executives edited by Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., her elegant book is a liberal's take on the complex, sphinxlike founder of American liberalism. Appleby convincingly argues that the third president's greatest legacies were limited government (breached, however, by the opportunism that characterized his own presidency) and the great expansion of democracy. If some of her criticisms of Jefferson seem more perfunctory than heartfelt, she fully explains the man's sorry record and tortured views on slavery and race. Providing along the way a short, up-to-date history of the early 19th-century nation, she also concisely surveys the day's great issues-voting, democracy, political parties, commerce, westering and religion. Yet such a balanced picture of Jefferson remains somehow unsatisfactory, no doubt because a man of so many contradictions slips away from every biographer, the tensions in the man mirroring those of his times. Appleby tries to toss a bouquet to the man who vanquished the Federalist Party and purchased the Louisiana Territory. She wants to convince us that Jefferson was "one of history's most intuitive politicians," but even in Appleby's capable hands, Jefferson remains the most unfathomable political figure in our history. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Junqueira&#39;s Basic Histology: Text and Atlas, Thirteenth Edition</h2><p><p><b>The histology text the medical field turns to first -- authoritative, concise, beautifully illustrated, and completely up-to-date</b></p> <p><b><i>More than 600 full-color illustrations</i></b></p> <p>For more than three decades, <i>Junquiera's Basic Histology</i> has been unmatched in its ability to explain the relationship between cell and tissue structure with their function in the human body.

It is available in paperback copy and ebook versions. Barbara wrote this book following years of not only being at the bedside of hundreds of persons at their moment of death but with them as their hospice nurse in the months before their actual death. From the stories and experiences she shares you will see the unfolding of a process, a dying process, vs. death just happening. By being at the bedside during a time in our culture when a person dying was usually in the hospital, in a private room and very much alone, Barbara brings to the forefront of our consciousness the dynamics of dying from disease and old age. We will all be affected by dying, death and grief at some time in our lives. The Final Act of Living: Reflections of a Long-time Hospice Nurse is a book on end of life that offers knowledge and clarity to ease the fear and misinformation about dying and death. It explores the topics of living with a life threatening illness, fear of death, understanding the signs of approaching death from disease, the dying process, stages of death, the normal grieving process, living wills and other end of life issues. The Final Act of Living is used as a resource on end of life issues, a training handbook for hospice volunteers, a reference book for lay ministers, social workers, counselors, nurses, and chaplains. An easy read for anyone interested in dying and grief a text book in college and university classes, CNA training classes, social work classes, and LPN/RN classes This material may be described as an end of life book however, as the title states, its content and philosophy is all about The Final Act of Living.</p><p>&#34;The Final Act of Living&#34; will appeal to anyone who is searching for information regarding the dying expereince.

In more than sixty essays by an international team of scholars, this volume explores the full breadth and reach of Greek thought--investigating what the Greeks knew as well as what they thought about what they knew, and what they believed, invented, and understood about the conditions and possibilities of knowing. Calling attention to the characteristic reflexivity of Greek thought, the analysis in this book reminds us of what our own reflections owe to theirs.</p><p>In sections devoted to philosophy, politics, the pursuit of knowledge, major thinkers, and schools of thought, this work shows us the Greeks looking at themselves, establishing the terms for understanding life, language, production, and action. The authors evoke not history, but the stories the Greeks told themselves about history; not their poetry, but their poetics; not their speeches, but their rhetoric. Essays that survey political, scientific, and philosophical ideas, such as those on Utopia and the Critique of Politics, Observation and Research, and Ethics; others on specific fields from Astronomy and History to Mathematics and Medicine; new perspectives on major figures, from Anaxagoras to Zeno of Elea; studies of core traditions from the Milesians to the various versions of Platonism: together these offer a sense of the unquenchable thirst for knowledge that marked Greek civilization--and that Aristotle considered a natural and universal trait of humankind.

Original in its explanations and illuminating in its definitions, the Glossary brings out the richness and subtley found in Elizabethan English. Incorporating the many advances made in the field since the last (revised) edition was published in 1919, this volume reveals new facts about the meanings of words in Shakespeare, alters previous interpretations, and resolves earlier controversies. In addition, the book takes advantage of two highly accurate, computer based concordances that make every occurrence of each word immediately accessible for investigation and comparison.

Paul Farmer, a physician and anthropologist with twenty years of experience working in Haiti, Peru, and Russia, argues that promoting the social and economic rights of the world&#x2019;s poor is the most important human rights struggle of our times. With passionate eyewitness accounts from the prisons of Russia and the beleaguered villages of Haiti and Chiapas, this book links the lived experiences of individual victims to a broader analysis of structural violence. Farmer challenges conventional thinking within human rights circles and exposes the relationships between political and economic injustice, on one hand, and the suffering and illness of the powerless, on the other.<br><br>Farmer shows that the same social forces that give rise to epidemic diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis also sculpt risk for human rights violations. He illustrates the ways that racism and gender inequality in the United States are embodied as disease and death. Yet this book is far from a hopeless inventory of abuse. Farmer&#x2019;s disturbing examples are linked to a guarded optimism that new medical and social technologies will develop in tandem with a more informed sense of social justice. Otherwise, he concludes, we will be guilty of managing social inequality rather than addressing structural violence. Farmer&#x2019;s urgent plea to think about human rights in the context of global public health and to consider critical issues of quality and access for the world&#x2019;s poor should be of fundamental concern to a world characterized by the bizarre proximity of surfeit and suffering.</p><p>"This is an angry and a hopeful book, and, like everything Dr. Farmer has written, it has both passion and authority. <i>Pathologies of Power</i> is an eloquent plea for a working definition of human rights that would not neglect the most basic rights of all: food, shelter and health. This plea has special potency because it comes from Dr. Farmer, a person who has proven that the dream of universal and comprehensive human rights is possible, and who has brought food, shelter, health, and hope to some of the poorest people on this earth."&#x2014;Tracy Kidder, author of <i>The Soul of a New Machine</i> and <i>Home Town</i><br><br>"Farmer's brilliance and charisma leap from the pages of his book. He challenges us to face the urgent theoretical and political challenges of the twenty-first century by linking structural violence to embodied social suffering and in the process calls for a new definition of human rights. Once this book is out, we will no longer be able to remain complacently--or rather, complicitly--on the sidelines."&#x2014;Philippe Bourgois, author of <i>In Search of Respect: Selling Crack in El Barrio</i><br><br>"A passionate critique of conventional biomedical ethics by one of the world's leading physician-anthropologists and public intellectuals. Farmer's on-the-ground analysis of the relentless march of the AIDS epidemic and multi-drug resistant tuberculosis among the imprisoned and the sick-poor of the world illuminates the pathologies of a world economy that has lost its soul."&#x2014;Nancy Scheper-Hughes , author of <i>Death without Weeping: the Violence of Everyday Life in Brazil</i><br><br>"In his compelling book, Farmer captures the central dilemma of our times&#x2014;the increasing disparities of health and well-being within and among societies. While all member countries of the United Nations denounce the gross violations of human rights perpetrated by those who torture, murder, or imprison without due process, the insidious violations of human rights due to structural violence involving the denial of economic opportunity, decent housing, or access to health care and education are commonly ignored. <i>Pathologies of Power </i>makes a powerful case that our very humanity is threatened by our collective failure to end these abuses."&#x2014;Robert S. Lawrence, President of Physicians for Human Rights and Edyth Schoenrich Professor of Preventive Medicine at the Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University<br><br>"Farmer has given us that most rare of books: one that opens both our minds and hearts. It stands as a model of engaged scholarship and an urgent call for social scientists to forsake their cushy disregard for human rights at home and abroad."&#x2014;Lo�c Wacquant, author of <i>Prisons of Poverty</i><br><br>"Paul Farmer is an original: a powerful writer, an insightful theorist, and a human rights activist on behalf of the health needs of some of the poorest and most excluded people on the planet. <i>Pathologies of Power</i> brings together all his strengths, as a thinker and an activist. Every health worker, human rights teacher, and government official who seeks to improve the health status and life chances of their fellow human beings simply must read this book."&#x2014;Michael Ignatieff, author of <i>Human Rights as Politics and Idolatry</i><br><br>"Paul Farmer is a great doctor with massive experience working against the hardest of diseases in the most adverse circumstances, and, at the same time, he is a proficient and insightful anthropologist. Farmer's knowledge of maladies such as AIDS and drug-resistant tuberculosis, which he fights on behalf of his indigent patients, is hard to match. But what is particularly relevant in appreciating the contribution of this powerful book is that Farmer is a visionary analyst who looks beyond the details of fragmentary explanations to seek an integrated understanding of a complex reality."&#x2014;Amartya Sen, Nobel Laureate, Economics<b>Paul Farmer</b> is Presley Professor of Medical Anthropology at Harvard Medical School, Chief of the Division of Social Medicine and Health Inequalities at Brigham and Women&#x2019;s Hospital, and Founding Director of Partners In Health.

It familiarizes students with the basics of test construction and prepares them to effectively evaluate different tests, choose tests for particular purposes and individual examines, and interpret scores properly.The 1990&#39;s have witnessed a continuation and expansion of the upsurge of interest in psychological testing that was evident in the 1980&#39;s. This growth is indicated by the development of new tests some representing novel approaches as well as by the revisions of earlier tests and continued research on existing tests. In selecting instruments for mention or discussion, a primary goal was to expose readers to the rich variety of measurement tools available in the field today, as well as to some historically significant tests and techniques: and attempt to cover the field or even a significant segment of it in a comprehensive fashion would have been clearly beyond the scope of this book.</p><h2>The Seer&#39;s Path: An Invitation to Experience Heaven, Angels, and the Invisible Realm of the Spirit</h2><p><p><b>Open your eyes to discover the invisible world of the spirit realm!</b></p> <p>Just beyond what your eyes can see, there is a very real <i>spirit world</i>.

Reading through the pages, I had one word that kept coming to me as descriptive of the heart of this book and the major impact that it will have on you, the reader. That word is &#x201c;practical.&#x201d; Seeing is practical, and this book gives practical insights into how you can see! You will come to grips with just how important the whole area of seeing into the spiritual realm is. Seeing what God is doing is biblical, it is real. Seeing is how our Bible heroes functioned, and how they could do all that they did. Jesus has purposed, destined, and equipped us to see in this arena. Ana gives insights into how this has influenced her daily life. Then she provides applications and help for us to flow in this area as well. Finally, each chapter concludes with powerful prayers of release that as you agree with them, will literally happen! You will experience a release, an unlocking to be a seer! <br> There is another reason that I can recommend this book so highly. I know the Werners. They are a vital part of the church I pastor and I know their character. I not only recommend the content of the book, I recommend the author! The Seer&#x2019;s path is a great read and even better application. <br><br> ALAN KOCH<br> Founding pastor of Christ Triumphant Church<br><br> It is with certainty of character and giftings that I recommend Ana Werner to you! Seeing in the Spirit comes with revelation and responsibility, Ana knows and understands &#x201c;to whom much is given, much is required&#x201d; (Luke 12:48).

You will enjoy Ana&#x2019;s experiences with the angelic and the Lord; she will convince you that there is more to this Christian life then you are experiencing now. Maybe you didn&#x2019;t meet your guardian angel when you were five years old; she did. Maybe you have never been interrupted while doing dishes and have an angel knock on your door and make an appointment with you for later when your little daughter was taking her nap; she has. We know and love Ana, her husband, and her children. She is as real as your next door neighbor, but she experiences the supernatural in a way that will challenge and change your life.

Charlie, a simple young man who was born with a very low IQ, became a perfect subject for an experimental surgery to improve his intelligence, an experiment that was successful for Algernon, a mouse A novella that won the Hugo Award in 1960 and the Nebula in 1966 and inspired the film Charly for which Cliff Robertson received an Oscar for Best Actor in 1969. In Chinese. Distributed by Tsai Fong Books, Inc.</p><p>Daniel Keyes wrote little SF but is highly regarded for one classic, <i>Flowers for Algernon</i>. As a 1959 novella it won a Hugo Award; the 1966 novel-length expansion won a Nebula. The Oscar-winning movie adaptation <i>Charly</i> (1968) also spawned a 1980 Broadway musical.<p> Following his doctor's instructions, engaging simpleton Charlie Gordon tells his own story in semi-literate "progris riports." He dimly wants to better himself, but with an IQ of 68 can't even beat the laboratory mouse Algernon at maze-solving: </p><p> </p><blockquote>I dint feel bad because I watched Algernon and I lernd how to finish the amaze even if it takes me along time. <p> I dint know mice were so smart.</p></blockquote> <p> Algernon is extra-clever thanks to an experimental brain operation so far tried only on animals. Charlie eagerly volunteers as the first human subject. After frustrating delays and agonies of concentration, the effects begin to show and the reports steadily improve: "Punctuation, is? fun!" But getting smarter brings cruel shocks, as Charlie realizes that his merry "friends" at the bakery where he sweeps the floor have all along been laughing at him, never with him. The IQ rise continues, taking him steadily past the human average to genius level and beyond, until he's as intellectually alone as the old, foolish Charlie ever was--and now painfully aware of it. Then, ominously, the smart mouse Algernon begins to deteriorate... </p><p> <i>Flowers for Algernon</i> is a timeless tear-jerker with a terrific emotional impact. <i>--David Langford</i></p>Published in hardcover by Harcourt, 1967, (reissued 1995), 0-15-100163-4<br>Published in paperback by Bantam, 1968, (reissued 1984), 0553274503<br></p><h2>Business Ethics: Case Studies and Selected Readings (South-western Legal Studies in Business Academic Series)</h2><p>Packed with real-life examples of business decisions gone awry, the 8th Edition of BUSINESS ETHICS: CASE STUDIES AND SELECTED READINGS explores the complex issues of business ethics from the leaders&#39; perspectives.

Gaskell&#x2019;s work had great importance to the labour and reform movements, and it influenced writers such as Charles Dickens, Thomas Carlyle and Charlotte Bront�. </p> <p> The plot of Mary Barton concerns the poverty and desperation of England&#x2019;s industrial workers. Fundamentally, however, it revolves around Mary&#x2019;s personal conflicts. She is already divided between an affection for an industrialist&#x2019;s son, Henry Carson, and for a man of her own class, Jem Wilson. But Mary&#x2019;s conflict escalates when her father, a committed trade unionist, is asked to assassinate Henry, who is the son of his unjust employer. </p></p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price.

Brown's trilogy on civilization and its discontents, on humanity's long struggle to master its instincts and the perils that attend that denial of human nature. Following on his famous books <i>Life Against Death</i> and <i>Love's Body</i>, this collection of eleven essays brings Brown's thinking up to 1990 and the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe.<br><br>Brown writes that "the prophetic tradition is an attempt to give direction to the social structure precipitated by the urban revolution; to resolve its inherent contradictions; to put an end to its injustice, inequality, anomie, the state of war . . . that has been its history from start to finish." Affiliating himself with prophets from Muhammad to Blake and Emerson, Brown offers further meditations on what's wrong with Western civilization and what we might do about it. Thus the duality in his title: crisis and the hope for change. In pieces both poetic and philosophical, Brown's attention ranges over Greek mythology, Islam, Spinoza, and <i>Finnegan's Wake</i>. The collection includes an autobiographical essay musing on Brown's own intellectual development. The final piece, "Dionysus in 1990," draws on Freud and the work of Georges Bataille to link the recent changes in the world's economies with mankind's primordial drive to accumulation, waste, and death.</p><p>"Few of the masters of modern consciousness have continued to develop as Brown has done.

In our culture, "fat" has become a four-letter word. Or, as Lance Armstrong said to the wife of a former teammate, "I called you crazy. I called you a bitch. But I never called you fat." How did we get to this place where the worst insult you can hurl at someone is "fat"? Where women and girls (and increasingly men and boys) will diet, purge, overeat, undereat, and berate themselves and others, all in the name of being thin?<br><br>As a science journalist, Harriet Brown has explored this collective longing and fixation from an objective perspective; as a mother, wife, and woman with "weight issues," she has struggled to understand it on a personal level. Now, in <i>Body of Truth</i>, Brown systematically unpacks what's been offered as "truth" about weight and health.<br><br>Starting with the four biggest lies, Brown shows how research has been manipulated; how the medical profession is complicit in keeping us in the dark; how big pharma and big, empty promises equal big, big dollars; how much of what we know (or think we know) about health and weight is wrong. And how all of those affect all of us every day, whether we know it or not.<br><br>The quest for health and wellness has never been more urgent, yet most of us continue to buy into fad diets and unattainable body ideals, unaware of the damage we're doing to ourselves. Through interviews, research, and her own experience, Brown not only gives us the real story on weight, health, and beauty, but also offers concrete suggestions for how each of us can sort through the lies and misconceptions and make peace with and for ourselves.<br></p><p><b>Harriet Brown</b> is the author of <i>Brave Girl Eating: A Family's Struggle with Anorexia</i>, which has been translated into several languages and won a Books for a Better Life Award in 2011.

He is a paleontologist who designs robotic space probes and relativistic rockets. In his spare time, Pellegrino writes mindbending technothrillers. Jan de Bont, the director of Speed and Twister, has recently signed on to direct the film adaptation of Pellegrino&#39;s Dust. Dr. Pellegrino lives in New York.Pellegrino and Zebrowski hang a whirlwind of ideas within the framework of the traditional sf concept of first contact with intelligent aliens. Their yarn is full of action and danger to the human race, too--and without dividing the cast into good guys and bad. Among their double handful of ideas are concepts concerning enhanced human intelligence, several superweapons, new energy sources, and the <i>Titanic</i> disaster (on which Pellegrino is a recognized expert). All of this does not make the book's plot easy to follow. On the other hand, all the idea mongering shows so much creativity and knowledge that you almost wind up not caring whether the book has a plot. Pellegrino and Zebrowski are working territory not too far removed from Arthur C. Clarke's, and anywhere Clarke is popular, this book should be, too. <i>Roland Green</i></p><h2>The Wild Woman&#39;s Way: Unlock Your Full Potential for Pleasure, Power, and Fulfillment</h2><p>Discover how to create and enjoy a pleasure-filled and meaningful life with this practical tantra handbook for the high-achieving modern woman.<br><br>For women today, achieving a successful career, a fulfilling romantic relationship, and a rewarding personal life can feel like opposing goals, leaving their deepest yearnings just beyond reach.

It is a call to return to the inborn genius that guides our passion, whispers in our ear with longing, and reveals itself abundantly when we allow our bodies to show us the way.<br> <br>This is a deeply personal book, born from my own explorations, struggles, and victories, infused with my passion carried over the span of more than twenty years of teaching and mentoring individuals and couples in the realms of relationship and sexuality.<br> <br>I am focusing here on women&#x2019;s bodies, for a few reasons.<br> <br>First, I am happily living in a woman&#x2019;s body&#x2014;yes, I said happily!&#x2014;and as such am continually traversing both the fertile lands of feeling embodiment and the turbulent seas of unfeeling numbness. I am also the lineage holder, a keeper and teacher of the ancient wisdom of a Kashmiri Tantric tradition that has been passed down from woman to woman for thousands of years, and, as such, am dedicated to empowering women&#x2019;s understanding of their bodies as a devotional vehicle. I see the current cultural emergence of the sacred feminine as a beautiful opportunity for exploration and growth, and, at the same time, a movement fraught with the dangers of gender wars and false entitlement.<br> <br>I am writing this book mainly for women. I also hope that men will benefit: in their relationship with their own bodies, and by gaining a different access to and understanding about what it is like to be a woman in the twenty-first century.<br> <br>I personally love men, and am fortunate to be surrounded by wonderful, talented men with generous hearts. This is not a book to set men against women and fuel a battle of the sexes; it is instead an exploration of what defines us as men and women, what unites us, and how to become whole and serve one another as we traverse these extraordinary times.<br> <br>Never have we as women in the West had more opportunity, more choice, and more freedom. Granted, we still have a long way to go, yet compared to any other time in history, we have the greatest options and choices to forge our own paths and determine our own destinies. At the same time, with these opportunities come new challenges and distinct difficulties: the demands of life have created unprecedented levels of stress, pressure, disconnect, discomfort, and dis-ease in women.<br> <br>We women are now, more than ever, able to have the careers we want, whether that is to be an entrepreneur, a CEO, a full-time parent, an educator, or a social media sensation. We make our own money and our own decisions. We vote, we march, and we support our causes. We have more freedom today than ever before to determine the kind of relationships we want&#x2014;and freedom to determine if, and how, we will birth and raise children, and to make decisions about how our households will be taken care of.<br> <br>With all these options, there are a dizzying variety of versions of &#x201c;Woman&#x201d; to which we can aspire: Boardroom Executive, Mother, Entrepreneur, Martha-Stewart-like Homemaker, Vixen in the Bedroom, Visionary, Academic, Artist, Yogini, Leader, Goddess, Scientist, Earth Mother, Warrior. We are told we should &#x201c;lean in,&#x201d; &#x201c;drop out,&#x201d; and, on top of it all, &#x201c;be forever young and radiant.&#x201d;<br> <br>Then there are the spiritual choices. We can practice yoga, chant, dance ecstatically, meditate in a vast variety of traditions, go Zen, swirl like a Sufi, discover the Goddess or reclaim God, take &#x201c;plant medicines,&#x201d; and embrace a variety of pagan traditions. We can follow one teacher, or piece all the above together into our own � la carte menu of spirituality.<br> <br>We can even combine our quests of spirit and sex through a variety of ?Tantric explorations. The options to work on our feminine wiles have vastly increased, from wrapping ourselves around a stripper pole, to &#x201c;vajazzling&#x201d; our previously private parts, to sex-toy parties and hands-on classes on how to achieve multiple orgasms.<br> <br>Regardless of what we choose (and regardless of how tired we are), we are also women who want meaningful relationships and fulfilling sex lives, with all their inherent benefits and responsibilities.<br> <br>The good news: amidst such a multitude of options we are free to choose what resonates with us. The bad news: it&#x2019;s confusing, overwhelming, time-consuming, fraught with many pitfalls, and requires constant discernment.<br> <br>No wonder we often find ourselves confused, stressed, and unsure of what to do and how to be. Even though there are abundant choices, there are subtle (and sometimes not-so-subtle) pressures from society, spiritual and communal dogma, our own belief systems, and the habit patterns of our past that tell us that we have to be Superwoman to be loved, or that our real choices are narrower than we thought them to be.<br> <br>More than ever, it&#x2019;s time for each of us to ask ourselves:<br> <br>Who am I out in the world?<br> <br>Who am I when no one is watching?<br> <br>What does my unguarded heart yearn for?<br> <br>Who am I when everything is stripped away?<br> <br>How does my body want to move when I am alone?<br> <br>What would I do if nothing was required of me?<br> <br>These are the kinds of questions I ask women in my workshops. When they hear them for the first time, their initial response is almost always stunned silence.<br> <br>Within the swirl of all the demands and options of a busy life, it becomes hard to know who we are, and almost impossible to discern what our best choices are.<br> <br>In the midst of this paradox of opportunity and confusion, we have become disconnected from our most valuable ally: our body.<br> <br>Stress, tension, overwhelm, and excess mental activity are drowning out our feeling. We no longer notice our bodily sensations or our emotions as they attempt to arise within our being. Without access to the subtle genius of our feeling body, we have a reduced ability to discern and respond accurately.<br> <br>Thankfully, the way out of this conundrum is neither time-consuming nor expensive, and it is within the reach of every woman, no matter her schedule and commitments. In fact, the process of reconnecting with our bodily genius is something profoundly natural to every woman.<br> <br>The solution lies not in adding to or enhancing our bodies, or chasing after some external ideal; it lies in remembering that the body is not just a vehicle that needs to be maintained (or disciplined) so that we can function; rather, it is a potent source of power, intuition, feeling, and abundant pleasure.<br> <br>Feeling is our birthright. It is innate wisdom, and through reconnecting with it, we can re-wild ourselves back to our original nature: the place we started from, before layers of doing, pushing, and obligation clouded over who we are.<br> <br>In this book, I share the lessons I learned myself, not only over years of building a career while maintaining a marriage but also from a lifetime of commitment to and exploration in the creative and spiritual inner life. These, together with my Tantric training, and my many years of giving workshops and client sessions, form the basis for the exercises and teachings presented in each chapter.<br> <br>Working with this book, you will gain understanding of the challenges that are unique to women at this moment, as well as the mechanics that drive our bodies and minds.<br> <br>You will receive information and practices to help you re-sensitize yourself and come back to your body.<br> <br>By reconnecting with your feeling body, you will begin to allow its innate wisdom to inform you. As you rediscover instinct, intuition, and power, you will gain the discernment to make decisions that honor your own true nature, as well as that of others.<br> <br>From there, we will explore what you are devoted to&#x2014;your passion, purpose, and heart&#x2019;s yearning&#x2014;so that you can infuse your career, your relationships, and your creative and spiritual life with your deepest meaning.<br> <br>And then, once your body and heart have reconnected, we&#x2019;ll explore your relationship to sensual and sexual pleasure within yourself, and as an offering to the partner of your choice.<br> <br>The practices in this book are easy to incorporate into your life. They don&#x2019;t require big changes or great time commitments. They are designed to gradually integrate what is important to you into your existing routine. They allow you to shift and explore gently, from the inside out, infusing everything you do with who you are at your very core: the wild, untamed, undomesticated, embodied self that has always been there.<br> My Journey<p></p> <br>When I was twelve, I decided to become a witch. Not that I really knew what that meant, but I had very strong ideas nonetheless. I was going to have a house in the country, with lots of animals and a large kitchen garden. I envisioned people coming to receive potions and spells. I could see it clearly and had distinct ideas of what I would do to empower and heal the women coming to my door.<br> <br>My father&#x2019;s godfather gifted me a copy of The Mists of Avalon for my twelfth birthday. I was a voracious reader, and finished the book in record time. I read about priestesses, sorceresses, and powerful women, about the mother lineage, gods and goddesses uniting in ritual for the sake of the land (not that, as a twelve-year-old, I had any idea what that really meant, either).<br> <br>This book introduced me to the concepts of nondualism and reincarnation, which, strangely, to my twelve-year-old self, made perfect sense. I was determined to learn about herb lore, water magic, and how to grow and harvest healing herbs in concert with the moon. As far as I was concerned, my career path was clear.<br> <br>I grew up in a rural part of Austria, an area made famous to filmgoers as the meadows that Julie Andrews skipped upon in The Sound of Music. This part of Austria was still connected to its Celtic roots, so it was easy for me to immerse myself in the rituals and teachings of working with the moon and elements. A local woman named Magdalena introduced me to Celtic biodynamic practices and herb lore.<br> <br>I was educated in an all-girls school, which, at the time, caused me great upset; yet in hindsight, I can&#x2019;t thank my parents enough. Educated in this way, I had no sense of girls being less than boys, or of women being discriminated against or uneducated.<br> <br>On the contrary, I was schooled with rigor and academic excellence in a curriculum that was both heavy on science and also had all the teachings of a finishing school. My schoolmates and I were taught how to cook, sew, and knit, and at the same time, to speak three languages, translate Caesar&#x2019;s Bellum Gallicum, and to explore black holes and red dwarfs, as well as career skills in the modern working world. When I was sixteen, I had to spend two weeks during summer holidays apprenticing at a hospital, in the delivery and newborn ward (an experience that proved to be a better contraceptive than any parental talk ever could have been!).<br> <br>In this educational environment, I had no idea that there was such a thing as &#x201c;the patriarchy,&#x201d; and grew up with a sense of possibility, and the confidence that I could do anything I wanted.<br> <br>When I was in my mid-teens, the herb woman, Magdalena, introduced me to a friend of hers, an Indian woman named Deepa who was skilled in Ayurveda and potion-making, and I eagerly began to study with her. She became my mentor and teacher.<br> <br>My time was divided between school, tending and riding horses, and learning about the mysteries of spices, teas, sound, and movement from my teacher. For the first few years, all I learned from my teacher was how to make chai, by tasting, working with, and combining each ingredient at length. I also swept, and swept, and swept some more around a very leafy tree in her courtyard; the ground around it had to be clean at all times for the chalk paintings she drew each day as a meditative practice.<br> <br>Over time, it became clear to me that there was more to this woman than chai tea and chalk paintings. As I began to pass tests of concentration, commitment, and consistency that were woven into these initial practices, she began to invite me deeper into the knowledge that she carried and practiced.<br> <br>Chai-making gave way to the secret practices of her lineage, and it soon became clear that this unusual woman was in fact a true Tantrika, a stealth householder who shared her knowledge only when it could be received. She was the very embodiment of both deep mystery and the sacred ordinary.<br> <br>Many of the lessons and skills she taught me in those years form the basis of my teaching and my life today. It was only much later that I realized the wisdom behind her insistence on keeping things in her particular way. By having me repeat seemingly boring, mundane tasks over and over, she instilled in me focus, concentration, and discipline, all things that by no means came naturally to me. Only when I had integrated these lessons was I ready for the deeper teachings: the teachings of the wisdom of the body.<br> <br>Over the years, as I continued to study with my teacher, I pursued an education in psychology and worked at a variety of jobs. I moved twice to follow my teacher when she moved to different cities in Germany. From those first chai lessons in my mid-teens until I was twenty-eight, I dedicated myself body and soul to the ancient lineage of women into which I had been invited.<br> <br>Then, through a series of twists and turns, I moved to Los Angeles. In the beginning, I worked a full-time day job while building a private counseling practice in the evenings. Somewhere along the way, I forgot about the pursuit of &#x201c;witchy&#x201d; and magical things and instead became a businesswoman. I often spent twelve to fourteen hours a day working, splitting my time between the actual counseling work I was passionate about and the endless loop of booking clients, getting new ones, keeping on top of paperwork, and managing my practice.<br> <br>Over the years, I built a wildly successful full-time counseling practice and began working with celebrities, entertainers, high-performers, and family offices.<br> <br>When I met my future husband, I realized that my driven, hardworking, goal-oriented consultant persona got in the way of enjoying my personal life. I was no longer able to switch out of &#x201c;go&#x201d; mode easily, and it took some work (and struggle) to reconcile the various parts of me. Searching for balance, I began to remember the practices I had been taught, and started a women&#x2019;s circle in the garage of my house.<br> <br>The circle met twice a month, and the connection with the other women in the group became an important part of my life. We were all exploring the same themes: having a career, and wanting a fulfilling relationship and time for self-expression, yet feeling stuck in achieving those goals. Realizing this, I began to experiment with different modalities for eac...</p><h2>Lift Every Voice: The History of African American Music (The African American Experience Series)</h2><p>Lift Every Voice traces the roots of black music in Africa and slavery and its evolution in the United States from the end of slavery to the present day. The music&#39;s creators, consumers, and distributors are all part of the story. Musical genres such as spirituals, ragtime, the blues, jazz, gospel, rhythm and blues, rock, soul, and hip-hop-as well as black contributions to classical, country, and other American music forms-depict the continuities and innovations that mark both the music and the history of African Americans. A rich selection of documents helps to define the place of music within African American communities and the nation as a whole.</p><p><b>Burton W. Peretti</b> is professor of history at Western Connecticut State University and author of <i>Jazz in American Culture</i>.This is an impressive and highly readable short narrative history of African American music. Peretti's treatment of the social and cultural dimensions of the music is especially compelling. (Waldo E. Martin Jr., University of California, Berkeley, author of No Coward Soldiers)<br><br>Peretti scores . . . in the ambitious task of capturing the many and varied contributions of African Americans to our musical heritage. Recommended as a college text or as a brief overview for general readers. (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br><i>Lift Every Voice</i> is distinguished by its unique scope and intended audience. . . . These texts do the important work of bringing readers into contact with actual manifestations of the culture(s) analyzed throughout the book. . . . It performs its function admirably. (<i>The Journal of Popular Culture</i>)<br><br>Peretti skillfully synthesizes decades of scholarship. He makes complicated music understandable by the layperson. He makes many insightful connections between African American music and its African antecedents. It is refreshing and rare (if not unprecedented) to see sections on classical, gospel, and avant-garde music referenced in the same context as blues, jazz, and soul music. And Peretti's analysis of the unequalled chart success of Michael Jackson's Thriller album is the best attempt I have seen to ascertain why the album resonates so strongly in African American culture and among audiences worldwide. (<i>Journal of American History</i>)<br><br>A well-researched and well-written introduction to the riches of African American music and its cultural context. An excellent book for the undergraduate classroom or the general reader. (Gerald Early, Washington University in St. Louis, editor of Miles Davis and American Culture)<br><br>Burton W. Peretti&#x2019;s Lift Every Voice contributes to a much-needed discussion of African American musical history by providing an important, albeit brief, visitation of the social issues entwined in the professional experience of some of the United States&#x2019; most important and influential artists.While there is no shortage of works that interpret the how and why of influential trends and performers, there is a need for books that provide a succinct who, what, when, and where of African American music since the 1970s. This type of &#x201c;blue collar&#x201d; scholarship, particularly focused on more modern music, would greatly add to the currently available literature. Lift Every Voice speaks to this need not only as a contribution to scholarship in African American music, but to a broader understanding of American society.

Kindergarten is becoming more like the rest of school. In&nbsp;<i>Lifelong&nbsp;Kindergarten</i>, learning expert Mitchel Resnick argues for exactly the opposite: the rest of school (even the rest of life) should be more like kindergarten. To thrive in today's fast-changing world, people of all ages must learn to think and act creatively&#x2015;and the best way to do that is by focusing more on imagining, creating, playing, sharing, and reflecting, just as children do in traditional kindergartens.</p><p>Drawing on&nbsp;experiences from more than thirty years at MIT's Media Lab, Resnick discusses new technologies and strategies for engaging young people in creative learning&nbsp;experiences. He tells stories of how children&nbsp;are programming their own games, stories, and inventions (for example, a diary security system, created by a twelve-year-old girl), and&nbsp;collaborating through remixing, crowdsourcing, and large-scale group projects (such as a Halloween-themed game called <i>Night at&nbsp;Dreary Castle</i>, produced by more than twenty kids scattered around the world). By providing young people with opportunities to work on projects,&nbsp;based on their passions, in collaboration with peers, in a playful spirit, we can help them prepare for a world where creative thinking is more important than&nbsp;ever before.</p></p><p>Mitchel Resnick, an expert in educational technologies, is Professor of Learning Research at the MIT Media Lab.His research group develops the Scratch programming software and online community, the world&#39;s largest coding platform for kids.

Each chapter builds an artistic understanding of how motion transforms the human figure and can create a sense of expressive vibrancy in one's art.</p><p>VALERIE L.

Based on collations of the two issues and the two impressions of the single edition publishing in Melville's lifetime, it incorporates necessary emendations made by the series editors. This text of <i>Pierre</i> is an Approved Text of the Center for Editions of American Authors (Modern Language Association of America).<br></p><p>This Kraken Edition of Pierre, or The Ambiguities is a reconstruction of the text that Melville delivered to Harper &amp; Brothers early in January 1852, just as some of the most devastating reviews of Moby-Dick were appearing. The Harper brothers apparently decided that Pierre was even more outrageous than Moby-Dick and tried to avoid publishing it by offering Melville less than half the royalties they had paid for his previous books. Accepting the humiliating contract, Melville took a self-destructive revenge. After Book XVI, he interpolated a new section on "Young America in Literature", in which he arbitrarily announced that his hero, Pierre, had been a juvenile author. Melville proceeded to add an intrusive "Pierre as author" sub-plot, disparaging American literary life and the world of publishing, which he left unassimilated into the book he had first completed. Melville scholar Hershel Parker has long believed that the psychological stature of Moby-Dick would best be understood in the light of the original, shorter version of Pierre, in his opinion "surely the finest psychological novel anyone had yet written in English". Moby-Dick and the reconstructed Pierre are at last revealed as complexly interlinked companion studies of the moods of thought - the Typee and Omoo of depth psychology. Furthermore, all Melville lovers will be challenged by Maurice Sendak's extraordinary pictures, which constitute a brilliantly provocative interpretation of Melville's study of moral and mental ambiguities.<p>Herman Melville (August 1, 1819 &#x2013; September 28, 1891) was an American novelist, short story writer, essayist, and poet. He is best known for his novel Moby-Dick. His first three books gained much contemporary attention (the first, Typee, becoming a bestseller), and after a fast-blooming literary success in the late 1840s, his popularity declined precipitously in the mid-1850s and never recovered during his lifetime. When he died in 1891, he was almost completely forgotten. It was not until the "Melville Revival" in the early 20th century that his work won recognition, especially Moby-Dick, which was hailed as one of the literary masterpieces of both American and world literature. He was the first writer to have his works collected and published by the Library of America.</p></p><h2>Petrarch&#39;s Lyric Poems: The Rime Sparse and Other Lyrics</h2><p>For teachers and students of Petrarch, Durling&#39;s edition of the poems has become the standard one.

Tour.</p><p>Despite scientific evidence to the contrary, as far as the health care profession is concerned the standard operating design of the human body is male. So when a book comes along as beautifully written and endlessly informative as Natalie Angier's <i>Woman: An Intimate Geography</i>, it's a cause for major celebration. Written with whimsy and eloquence, her investigation into female physiology draws its inspiration not only from scientific and medical sources but also from mythology, history, art, and literature, layering biological factoids with her own personal encounters and arcane anecdotes from the history of science. Who knew, for example, that the clitoris--with 8,000 nerve fibers--packs double the pleasure of the penis; that the gene controlling cellular sensitivity to male androgens, ironically enough, resides on the X-chromosome; or that stress hormones like cortisol and corticosterone are the true precursors of friendship?<p> The mysteries of evolution are not a new subject for Angier, a Pulitzer Prize-winning biology writer for the <i>New York Times</i> whose previous books include <i>The Beauty of the Beastly</i> and <i>Natural Obsessions</i>. The strengths of <i>Woman</i> begin with Angier's witty and evocative prose style, but its real contribution is the way it expands the definition of female "geography" beyond womb, breasts, and estrogen, down as far as the bimolecular substructure of DNA and up as high as the transcendent infrastructure of the human brain. <i>--Patrizia DiLucchio</i></p>Anchor paperback 2000, previous ISBN&nbsp;978-0385498418</p><h2>The Delicacy and Strength of Lace</h2><p>This moving, eighteen-month exchange of correspondence chronicles the friendship-through-the-mail of two extraordinary writers.<br><br>Leslie Marmon Silko is a poet and novelist.

The charming correspondences, which unfurled over the final year and a half of Wright&#39;s life (1978-1980), are all about the difficulties and sweet pleasures of life, work, writing, and encounters with mean roosters. Silko considers the ways in which her work is imbued with the spirit of her Laguna Pueblo Indian heritage. Wright discusses the need to let a poem sit for a while before showing it to the world, as a poem &#34;goes through changes ... when you leave it alone patiently, just as surely as a plant does, or an animal, or any other creature.&#34; Together they explore the catharsis of storytelling, the overwhelming power of words (&#34;how deeply we can touch each other with them,&#34; writes Silko), and the beauty of a gentle yet passionate friendship between like-minded souls.<i>The Delicacy and Strength of Lace</i><br><i>Letters between Leslie Marmon Silko and James Wright</i><br><br>This moving, eighteen-month exchange of correspondence chronicles the friendship-through-the-mail of two extraordinary writers.<br><br>Leslie Marmon Silko is a poet and novelist.

The central premise of Strategic Project Management Made Simple is that most projects and strategies never get off the ground because of adhoc, haphazard, and obsolete methods used to turn their ideas into coherent and actionable plans. Strategic Project Management Made Simple is the first book to couple a step-by-step process with an interactive thinking tool that takes a strategic approach to designing projects and action initiatives. Strategic Project Management Made Simple builds a solid platform upon four critical questions that are vital for teams to intelligently answer in order to create their own strong, strategic foundation. These questions are:<br> <br> 1. What are we trying to accomplish and why?<br> <br> 2. How will we measure success?<br> <br> 3. What other conditions must exist?<br> <br> 4. How do we get there?<br> <br> This fresh approach begins with clearly understanding the what and why of a project - comprehending the bigger picture goals that are often given only lip service or cursory reviews. The second and third questions clarify success measures and identify the risky assumptions that can later cause pain if not spotted early. The how questions - what are the activities, budgets, and schedules - comes last in our four-question system. By contrast, most project approaches prematurely concentrate on the how without first adequately addressing the three other questions. These four questions guide readers into fleshing out a simple, yet sophisticated, mental workbench called "the Logical Framework" - a Systems Thinking paradigm that lays out one's own project strategy in an easily accessible, interactive 4x4 matrix. The inclusion of memorable features and concepts (four critical questions, LogFrame matrix, If-then thinking, and Implementation Equation) make this book unique.</p><p><p>Praise for TERRY SCHMIDT and STRATEGIC PROJECT MANAGEMENT MADE SIMPLE</p> <p>"Terry's books guide your thinking about any reasonably complex goal you're trying to achieve.

It explores the most essential questions of the human psyche (e.g., Why do people help or harm others? How do influence professionals get us to do what they want, and how can we inoculate ourselves against their sometimes-insidious persuasion tactics? Why do social relationships exert such powerful effects on people's physical health?), and it does so with clever, ingenuitive research methods. <br><br>This edited volume is a textbook for advanced social psychology courses. Its primary target audience is first-year graduate students (MA or PhD) in social psychlogy, although it is also appropriate for upper-level undergraduate courses in social psychology and for doctoral students in disciplines connecting to social psychology (e.g., marketing, organizational behavior). The authors of the chapters are world-renowned leaders on their topic, and they have written these chapters to be engaging and accessible to students who are just learning the discipline.<br><br>After reading this book, you will be able to understand almost any journal article or conference presentation in any field of social psychology. You will be able to converse competently with most social psychologists in their primary research domain, a use skill that is relevant not only in daily life but also when interviewing for a faculty position.

The exuberant freedom of flappers drinking bathtub gin and dancing the Charleston did little to counter such powers of oppression as the rapidly rising Ku Klux Klan. Only the fictional wealth of F. Scott Fitzgerald's Jay Gatsby survived the stock market crash unscathed; by the end of the decade, the comic adventures of Charlie Chaplin's "little tramp" bore faint resemblance to the grim realities faced by countless destitute Americans.</p><p>Too often, notes historian David Goldberg, the mythic allure of the "Roaring Twenties" has deafened our ears to the real voices of those who lived through the decade. In <i>Discontented America</i>, he integrates social and political history to provide a new take on the 1920s&#x2015;an account deeply rooted in the perspectives of that time. Goldberg argues that this contentious and fascinating decade should be viewed now as it was viewed then, as a distinctive postwar period, during which many of the conflicts generated by World War I continued to reverberate throughout American society.</p><p>As America sought to step back from the leadership role it had taken in the Great War, Goldberg explains, the nation faced internal battles over women's suffrage, prohibition of the sale of "intoxicating beverages," the specter of communism, and the declining power of labor unions. Large numbers of African Americans migrated from the southern states to the north in search of employment and a better life, and at the same time, there was another heavy wave of newcomers from overseas. These, Goldberg concludes, were the issues that preoccupied serious Americans, and their concern is reflected in the federal legislation of the period, from constitutional amendments providing for prohibition and women's suffrage to the National Origins Act, meant to curtail immigration from nonwestern European countries.</p><p>"The 1920s involved a time of confronting (or sometimes, ignoring) profound social problems, fears, and anxieties that had nagged the national consciousness for decades. David Goldberg very properly calls it a time of discontent, and in this work he thoroughly probes much of the underside of life that pitted Americans of differing classes, ethnicity, and religion against one another... As Goldberg notes, the Great Depression exposed underlying fallacies and weaknesses in the economy and provided the occasion for the great political and social transformation of the twentieth century. The achievements of the 1920s are long behind us, but the lessons of unbridled capitalism, intolerance, and the clashes between traditionalism and modernism very much remain."&#x2015;from the foreword by Stanley I.

We follow Chicago workers as they make choices about whether to attend ethnic benefit society meetings or to go to the movies, whether to shop in local neighborhood stores or patronize the new A &amp; P. Although workers may not have been political in traditional terms during the '20s, as they made daily decisions like these, they declared their loyalty in ways that would ultimately have political significance. As the depression worsened in the 1930s, not only did workers find their pay and working hours cut or eliminated, but the survival strategies they had developed during the 1920s were undermined. Looking elsewhere for help, workers adopted new ideological perspectives and overcame longstanding divisions among themselves to mount new kinds of collective action. Chicago workers' experiences as citizens, ethnics and blacks, wage earners and consumers all converged to make them into New Deal Democrats and CIO unionists.</p><p>The lives of Chicago workers are traced in the mid thirties to reveal how their experiences as citizens, members of ethnic or racial groups, wage earners and consumers, converged to transform them into New Deal Democrats and CIO unionists.Lizabeth Cohen is the Howard Mumford Jones Professor of American Studies in the History Department of Harvard University.

The foreign asset he was scheduled to meet at a downtown hotel in a country that can&#x2019;t be identified due to the sensitive nature of the CIA&#x2019;s work there had served the Agency well for twenty years, and his loyalty was thought to have been proven. The asset, whom we&#x2019;ll call &#x201c;Omar,&#x201d; had been questioned by CIA personnel on numerable occasions over the years in debriefings and routine security interviews, and his credibility was reinforced with every encounter. Omar had earned his stripes as a trusted partner who was prepared to carry out the mission whenever he was called upon.<br>Phil and an Office of Security colleague had been dispatched from their home base at Langley a couple of weeks earlier to conduct routine interviews with key assets in several countries in the region. Just like the CIA employees themselves, these assets had to be regularly interviewed to ensure that they continued to meet the Agency&#x2019;s stringent security requirements. The work was interesting&#x2014;it was always a welcome change to get out into the field&#x2014;but grueling. These interviews could be extraordinarily intense and could go on for hours if an asset showed any sign of deception under questioning.<br>A stickler for doing his homework, Phil reviewed Omar&#x2019;s file like he was preparing to coach his beloved East Carolina University Pirates in a game against Virginia Tech. He studied accounts of Omar&#x2019;s past activities as if he were watching game film, trying to pick up any obscure detail or nuance that would help ensure a win. When he finally closed the file, he basked in his good fortune. This one was going to be easy. Omar was obviously squeaky clean.<br>Phil&#x2019;s colleague caught him at the door as he was leaving their secured location to conduct the interview with Omar.<br>&#x201c;Hey, I guess you&#x2019;re not gonna be around to get some dinner later, huh?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh yeah, I will&#x2014;this one&#x2019;s a piece of cake,&#x201d; Phil assured him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be there in two hours.&#x201d;<br>His colleague was clearly skeptical. &#x201c;No way,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;Look, I finally got lucky,&#x201d; Phil insisted. &#x201c;I know I&#x2019;ve had a ton of tough ones lately, but this one&#x2019;s different. This guy&#x2019;s been looked at by so many of our guys that there really just isn&#x2019;t anything to worry about. Two hours.&#x201d;<br>Phil headed for the prearranged site of the meeting, a guest room in a high-rise hotel in the middle of town. Just getting Omar to the hotel was a clandestine operation in itself, a carefully choreographed plan that had been carried out with exacting precision to protect Omar from discovery by hostile intelligence services. When Phil and Omar were securely settled in the designated room&#x2014;a suite with a comfortable sitting area on one of the higher floors&#x2014;the two engaged in cordial conversation, and then Phil got down to business.<br>Phil sat on the sofa, and invited Omar to have a seat in the adjacent easy chair. With hundreds of similar interviews under his belt, Phil had the drill thoroughly rehearsed. He was relaxed, but businesslike, as he began to go through the prepared list of standard questions. Not surprisingly, Omar responded to them directly and comfortably&#x2014;Phil could see that after twenty years Omar, too, knew the drill.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve worked for us for years,&#x201d; Phil acknowledged. &#x201c;Have you ever worked for anybody else?&#x201d;<br>It was an easygoing way of confronting this longtime, trusted asset with the question that had to be asked: Had he ever worked for the bad guys? What happened next stunned Phil.<br>Omar shifted in his seat, paused, and with visible discomfort responded with a question: &#x201c;Can I pray?&#x201d;<br>Phil felt like a quarterback who&#x2019;d gotten creamed from behind as he scrambled out of the pocket. <i>Whoa. Where did THAT come from?</i> He had absolutely no expectation of seeing that behavior from Omar. And yet there it was.<br>&#x201c;Sure, no problem,&#x201d; Phil said, still recovering from the wallop. He expected Omar to bow his head for a few moments, and then proceed with his response. So what came next was even more puzzling.<br>Omar got up from the chair and went into the bathroom, and returned with a towel. Whatever this guy was doing, Phil was thinking, it wasn&#x2019;t good. And it simply didn&#x2019;t make any sense. Omar&#x2019;s unblemished record and Phil&#x2019;s certainty that he hadn&#x2019;t been lying in the interview to that point meant there had to be a reasonable explanation for Omar&#x2019;s actions.<br>Omar approached the window as Phil scrambled to make sense of what was happening. <i>What is this guy doing? Is he going to try to signal somebody with the towel? How bad is this going to get?</i> And then it dawned on him. Omar is Muslim. He was at the window to get his bearings so he could pray in the direction of Mecca. Muslims pray at set times throughout the day, and maybe this was one of those times.<br>Sure enough, Omar carefully spread the towel on the floor to use it as a prayer rug, and prostrated himself on it. As Omar prayed, Phil&#x2019;s mind was whirling, and he began to second-guess himself. Had he said anything to offend Omar? Had he been disrespectful of Omar&#x2019;s faith? He couldn&#x2019;t help but hope that it was his handling of the interview, not Omar&#x2019;s actions, that were problematic. After all, Omar was a key asset of the local CIA operation. If Phil were to go back with the claim that a source who had been trusted for so many years and cleared by so many previous interviewers was bad, the head of the local operation was likely to want Phil&#x2019;s scalp, not Omar&#x2019;s. Beyond all that, Phil was getting hungry, and the dinner appointment he promised he would keep was approaching. No one wanted to believe that Omar was clean more than Phil did.<br>After praying for about ten minutes, Omar arose, folded the towel, and returned to his seat. As Phil gathered his thoughts to resume the interview, he recognized that he was being swayed by his own bias in wanting to believe Omar, rather than sticking to an objective assessment of Omar&#x2019;s behavior. There was only one thing to do: hit him with the question again.<br>The response was hardly what Phil was hoping for. Omar paused and shifted his feet uneasily. &#x201c;Why are you asking me this?&#x201d; he protested. &#x201c;Is there a concern?&#x201d;<br>If there wasn&#x2019;t before, there was now. Omar&#x2019;s verbal and nonverbal behavior in response to the question told Phil it was time to shift into elicitation mode. Calling upon his well-honed skills in nonconfrontational interrogation, Phil became something of a human GPS, navigating to a predetermined destination: a confession.<br>Phil reached his destination sooner than even he expected. In less than an hour, Omar admitted that he had been working for an enemy intelligence service for the full twenty years that he had served as a CIA asset.<br>Still, Phil&#x2019;s job wasn&#x2019;t over. Instead, it took an essential twist. Now he had to be assured that Omar was telling the truth when he claimed to have been working for the bad guys all those years. Remaining squarely in interrogation mode, Phil began asking questions to elicit information that would corroborate Omar&#x2019;s confession. With the truth he managed to conceal for two decades finally exposed, Omar recounted how for years he had to pretend to be a novice when he underwent CIA training&#x2014;more often than not, he had already received the same training from the bad guys. He began to go into explicit detail about some of his successes against the Americans. One of his accomplishments was particularly chilling.<br>The individuals who hold the keys to the secrets of any CIA operation anywhere in the world are the communications officers. They are the ones who handle all the message traffic between their post, Langley, and other CIA posts worldwide. They have access to the CIA&#x2019;s ultrasensitive communications network and every classified document that&#x2019;s transmitted to or from their post. If hostile intelligence services see the personnel at a CIA post as a potential gold mine of information, the comms officers are the mother lode.<br>Omar, it turned out, had gotten disturbingly close to the communications personnel at the nearby CIA post. The location had two comms officers who shared a house and employed a servant from the local population. Omar had scored a major win by gaining eyes and ears inside the comms officers&#x2019; residence: He recruited the servant.<br>That revelation came as another body blow to Phil, who was well aware of the damage that such a compromise could inflict. This time, the impact was swiftly moderated. Omar went on to confide in Phil that after only a couple of months, the servant abruptly and unexpectedly quit his job at the comms officers&#x2019; home. When Omar went to his handler to deliver the bad news, the handler, a former competitive weight lifter, was so incensed that he picked up a chair and broke it with his bare hands. Omar told Phil he had no idea of the value the bad guys placed on having an asset within the comms officers&#x2019; living quarters, and he began to fear for his own safety when the handler got in his face and began screaming uncontrollably at him.<br>Phil nodded attentively and compassionately as Omar unloaded it all. Inside, he was exhilarated. He had missed plenty of dinner appointments with far less consolation.<br>It was dawn when Phil wrapped up the interview. Omar went on his way, no doubt well aware that measures were firmly in place to ensure that the necessary follow-up on his case could proceed. Phil went back to the CIA facility and immediately cabled Langley. The revelation of Omar&#x2019;s duplicity was received with near disbelief.

(The MIT Press)</h2><p><p><b>A lexicon and guide for discovering the essence of landscape.</b></p><p><b>&#x201c;Mr. Stilgoe does not ask that we take his book outdoors with us; he believes that reading and experiencing landscapes are activities that should be kept separate. But, as I learned in his book, the hollow storage area in a car driver's door was once a holster, the 'secure nesting place of a pistol.' I recommend you stow your copy there.&#x201d;<br></b><b><i>&#x2015;The Wall Street Journal</i></b></p><p>Landscape, John Stilgoe tells us, is a noun. From the old Frisian language (once spoken in coastal parts of the Netherlands and Germany), it meant shoveled land: <i>landschop</i>. Sixteenth-century Englishmen misheard or mispronounced this as <i>landskep</i>, which became<i> landskip</i>, then <i>landscape</i>, designating the surface of the earth shaped for human habitation. In <i>What Is Landscape?</i> Stilgoe maps the discovery of landscape by putting words to things, zeroing in on landscape's essence but also leading sideways expeditions through such sources as children's picture books, folklore, deeds, antique terminology, out-of-print dictionaries, and conversations with locals. (&#x201c;What is that?&#x201d; &#x201c;Well, it's not really a slough, not really, it's a bayou...&#x201d;) He offers a highly original, cogent, compact, gracefully written narrative lexicon of landscape as word, concept, and path to discoveries.</p><p><i>What Is Landscape? </i>is an invitation to walk, to notice, to ask: to see a sandcastle with a pinwheel at the beach and think of Dutch windmills&#x2015;icons of triumph, markers of territory won from the sea; to walk in the woods and be amused by the Elizabethans' misuse of the Latin <i>silvaticus </i>(people of the woods) to coin the word <i>savages</i>; to see in a suburban front lawn a representation of the meadow of a medieval freehold.</p><p>Discovering landscape is good exercise for body and for mind. This book is an essential guide and companion to that exercise&#x2015;to understanding, literally and figuratively, what landscape is.</p></p><p>John R. Stilgoe is Orchard Professor in the History of Landscape at Harvard University, where he has taught for forty years. He is the author of many books, most recently <i>Old Fields: Photography, Glamour, and Fantasy Landscape</i>.<p>This slim but densely packed volume affords innumerable insights into the relationships between language, landscape, history, and human perception. Weaving together long-lost lore, etymological esoterica, and astute observations on ongoing developments, Stilgoe challenges common assumptions and imbues overlooked environments with unheralded significance.</p>&#x2015;<b>Timothy Davis</b>, National Park Service landscape historian<br><br><p>John Stilgoe approaches the question 'What is landscape?' with a deep appreciation for the ways the environment is naturally endowed and a keen understanding of how it is culturally shaped.

Shearer</b>, Associate Professor and Co-Director of the Center for Sustainable Development, The University of Texas at Austin School of Architecture<br><br><p>With the energy and wisdom of a lifelong landscape traveler, Stilgoe leads us toward the deepest recesses of language and the most primal human labors, through it all urging us to pay more attention and to take more walks of our own.

P. Lovecraft<br> Arthur Machen (1863&#x2013;1947), Welsh novelist and essayist, is considered one of the most important and influential writers of his time. While displaying a preoccupation with pagan themes and matters of the occult &#x2014; an interest he shared with his close friend, the distinguished scholar A. E. Waite &#x2014; his writing transcends the genre of supernatural horror. Oscar Wilde, W. B. Yeats, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, as well as Paul Bowles and Jorge Luis Borges are just a few of the literary notables who are counted among his admirers. Machen is also a key figure in the development of pulp magazine fiction (e.g., <i>Weird Tales</i>), a line of ancestry that leads directly to today's popular graphic novels. Further, Machen's name often crops up in the writings of theorists and practitioners of psychogeography, a school of thought and literature which explores the hidden links between the landscape and the mind.<br> In "The Great God Pan," Arthur Machen delivers a tense atmospheric story about a string of mysterious suicides. With its suggestive visions of decadent sexuality, the work scandalized Victorian London. This edition also includes "The White People," "The Inmost Light," and "The Shining Pyramid." Taken together, these short stories are considered some of the first works of horror and have inspired generations of subsequent writers and creators.</p><p>Welsh novelist and essayist Arthur Machen (1863&#x2013;1947) ranks among the most important and influential writers of his era. Although preoccupied with pagan themes and occult practices, his writing transcends the genre of supernatural horror.

This important book revises that image, showing that the small but vibrant Dutch city produced fine examples of all the major arts&#x2014;including luxury goods and sophisticated paintings for the court at The Hague and for patrician collectors in Delft itself. <p>The book traces the history and culture of Delft from the 1200s through the lifetime of the city's most renowned painter, Johannes Vermeer. The authors discuss at length some ninety major paintings (seventeen by Vermeer), forty drawings, and a choice selection of decorative arts, all of which are reproduced in full color. Among the paintings are state portraits, history pictures, still lifes, views of palaces and church interiors, illusionistic murals, and refined genre pictures by Vermeer and Pieter de Hooch. The rich works on paper encompass exquisite drawings by Delft artists and sketches of the town by visiting artists. Included in the decorative arts are tapestries, bronze statuary, silver, Delftware, and glass. The volume concludes with an essay that takes the reader on a walk through seventeenth-century Delft. It is accompanied by maps of the city's neighborhoods that indicate major monuments and the homes of patrons, art dealers, and painters.</p></p><p>This handsome book serves as the catalogue for an exhibition to be held at The Metropolitan Museum of Art from 5 March to 27 May 2001 and at the National Gallery, London, from 20 June to 26 September 2001.Walter Liedtke is curator in the department of European paintings and Michiel C.

A model of beauty, fitness, and charm? A committed wife? A company president? A nurturing mother? A wise mentor? </p><p>Social mores, the feminist movement, the church, and the self-help movement have given women a myriad of messages about who they should be. But when they seek to live out all these messages at once, women often feel more frantic than fulfilled. So what's the answer? </p><p>A woman needs an identity that goes beyond self-fulfillment, primary relationships, or any of the possibilities in between, say Cynthia and Robert Hicks.

Cynthia is a counselor, women&#39;s speaker, and Bible study leader. Bob is a professor of pastoral theology at the Seminary of the East in Dresher, Pennsylvania, and the president of Life Counseling Services, a professional center for Christian counseling.Hicks reflects on her own life to identify six stages relating to biblical woman. The first, creational woman, is a stage in which many women struggle with self-esteem. Hicks believes that self-esteem is not something to be pursued, but something waiting to be discovered within each woman. The young-woman stage is one in which beauty can be a very powerful tool; a woman must attempt to find beauty within herself and through God. The nurturing woman embraces the pain and joys of motherhood. The relational woman celebrates, rather than denigrates, gender differences. Hicks believes that women, pursuing feminist goals, have abandoned the "blueprint" of roles and stereotypes, yet desperately seek a new direction. The wounded woman, whether widowed, divorced, or the victim of childhood trauma, experiences pain as she seeks contentment. Finally, the woman of strength is approaching the end of her journey and can claim maturity if she experiences self-acceptance of her current phase in life. Transition into each stage sometimes results in confusion and a temptation to stagnate; Hicks' continuing reminder to each woman is to "keep moving." <i>Patty O'Connell</i></p><h2>Warren Buffett Accounting Book: Reading Financial Statements for Value Investing</h2><p>The Warren Buffett Accounting Book is the second volume learning experience to Warren Buffett&#39;s Three Favorite Books.

Children with feeding disorders, food aversions, or selective eating often experience anxiety around food, and the power struggles can negatively impact your relationship with your child. Children with extreme picky eating can also miss out on parties or camp because they can&#x2019;t find &#x201c;safe&#x201d; foods. But you don&#x2019;t have to choose between fighting over every bite and only serving a handful of safe foods for years on end.<br>&nbsp;<br><em>Helping Your Child with Extreme Picky Eating</em> offers hope, even if your child has &#x201c;failed&#x201d; feeding therapies before. After gaining a foundation of understanding of your child&#x2019;s challenges and the dynamics at play, you&#x2019;ll be ready for the 5 steps (built around the clinically proven STEPS+ approach&#x2015;Supportive Treatment of Eating in PartnershipS) that transform feeding and meals so your child can learn to enjoy a variety of foods in the right amounts for healthy growth.

The authors&#x2019; expert handling of this topic will empower both professionals and parents to better understand and support their selective eaters.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Katherine Zavodni, MPH, RD, LDN</strong>, registered dietitian specializing in outpatient nutrition therapy for eating disorders, family nutrition and childhood feeding, and intuitive eating<br><br>&#x201c;<em>Helping Your Child with Extreme Picky Eating</em> is a practical, child-focused, and guilt-free guide to addressing a variety of eating challenges. This book respects and values the parent as an expert. The nonjudgmental approach and easy-to-follow techniques will empower parents to make family mealtime a positive experience. By providing a sound overview of feeding development, Rowell and McGlothlin changed my understanding of typical eating. The suggested scripts and keen insight into the child&#x2019;s perspective takes the guesswork out of applying the STEPS+. I walked away with a deeper understanding of how children experience feeding and how my own &#x2018;feeding temperament&#x2019; affects how I relate to my children around food. Short-order cooking is out the door and dessert is on the table with dinner now. We&#x2019;re all enjoying a happier mealtime!

Let&#x2019;s face it, eating is not just about nutrition. It&#x2019;s also about enjoyment and family relationships. This gets lost amidst health and medical concerns when a child severely limits his eating. Katja Rowell and Jenny McGlothlin have given us a map for restoring and healing these components as well.

Luke</h2><p>Every life retells the hero or heroine's journey: a wondrous, sometimes painful but always necessary movement toward wholeness. What better way to understand our own experiences of growth and transformation than to hear from others who have gone before us? In <i>Such Stuff as Dreams Are Made On</i> Helen Luke explores the inner life through dream and imagery, story and symbol.<br><br>The first half of the book covers Luke's life from her earliest recollections until the age of seventy. It weaves together dreams and symbolic images from her inner life with accounts of personal events, including her seminal meeting with Jung. The book's second half is comprised of selections from the journals she kept during her last twenty years of life, offering a rare glimpse into a personal path of individuation.</p><p>e devoted her life to the exploration of the self -- both her own and that of countless others who came to her for counseling. She was endowed with a deep grasp of archetypal forces and the ability to evoke them with luminous prose.<br><br><i>Such Stuff as Dreams Are Made On</i> consists of a memoir she wrote at the age of seventy but never published and excerpts culled from the fifty-four volumes of journals written in her final years. She weaves together dreams and symbolic images from her inner life with personal and world events, bringing a clear, unsentimental honesty and vibrant insight to all that she recounts. Reflecting on her past as a way of illuminating the present, Luke inspires us to be aware, attend to our personal truths, and "know and accept and live the next thing with devotion." This is Helen Luke's final and magnum opus -- her gift to the world."Helen Luke can strike one note with one finger with such sensitivity that it resonates forever in our soul."<br>Marion Woodman, author of Leaving My Father's House<br><br>"Helen Luke is a unique voice that carries beautiful passion, feeling, and clarity.

Illustrated with real market scenarios and applications, this powerful program will help psych you into a less stressful, more self-possessed mastery of the trading game and help you reach goals you may never have thought possible.<br> <br> "The strategies in this book will unleash the hidden trader in you, and can substantially increase your trading profits." --Jay G. Goldman, Hedge Fund Manager.<br> <br> "Ari Kiev has written a wonderful guide for money managers, traders, brokers, and investors alike. Sharing his thoughts with us regarding our behavior patterns enables us to take a step back and look at ourselves more objectively." --Seymour W. Zises, President and CEO, Family Management Corp.<br> <br> The trading arena has produced its share of select "super-traders," market practitioners who set themselves apart from the rest of the field with one distinct advantage: mental and emotional toughness. Like outstanding athletes who stay focused, remain calm, and stick to their game plan, these master traders in this highly risky, highly competitive arena possess an edge that keeps them from being distracted by fear, self-doubt, greed, and other emotional components that can cause major losses and prevent gains from soaring to new highs.<br> <br> Trading to Win presents a step-by-step, goal-oriented program for building the mental and emotional stamina not only to win, but to win on an unprecedented level. Created by a leading psychiatrist for a top trading firm, this proven approach spotlights a set of philosophical and behavioral principles designed to assist you in implementing proactive trading strategies, as well as developing the mindset needed to trade effectively in the realm of uncertainty. Delving into your underlying thought processes when you trade, Trading to Win enables you to understand what is motivating you, whether it is consistent with your game plan, and whether you are in any way sabotaging yourself.<br> <br> Fully supplemented with real market trading scenarios, Trading to Win shows you how to apply key concepts where it counts--in actual trading room situations. For both professional traders and sophisticated investors, this remarkable program offers a rare opportunity for both personal and financial gain.</p><p>Buy low, sell high. Sounds simple? Hardly. As most traders will tell you, finding the right entry and exit points in a market is too often a stressful and even gut-wrenching experience. Ari Kiev, author of <i>Trading to Win</i>, wants to change all that. Kiev spent five years with a group of professional traders at SAC Capital Management, a $500 million hedge fund, studying the psychological and emotional aspects of what makes for a successful trader. Kiev found that what hinders many traders is ego, fear, emotion, and "false beliefs about yourself and the markets." Gaining mastery as a trader means seeing "the market as it is, not as a reference point for your own existence." Kiev advocates a disciplined, Zen-like approach to the markets that begins with articulating a specific goal then committing oneself to attaining that goal in the most objective way possible, overcoming the emotional baggage that too often leads to poor decision-making. <i>Trading to Win</i> is for professional and amateur traders of every stripe who are looking for insight into their own behavior and approach to the markets. <i>--Harry C. Edwards</i>Virtually every top trader and investor attributes their success to a strong mental capacity and the ability to master their emotions. Even the best &#34;system&#34; can prove disastrous if the trader or investor doesn&#39;t have the ability to stick to their strategy. Yet, holding fast to a strategy can be extremely difficult while immersed in the trading game, since in essence, the mind seems to conspire against itself more than ever while in this milieu. The Psychology of Trading presents a step-by-step, goal-oriented approach to trading that emphasizes ways to keep emotions in check, overcome self-doubt, and focus clearly on a winning strategy. This new approach to trading has been developed by a leading psychiatrist, with expertise in sports psychology, and practiced by a top stock trader. While a plethora of books, seminars, and consultants address this vital area, no program has yet been developed by a trader and a psychiatrist. This is a proven approach, and it is outlined in an accessible and concise manner in the book.</p><h2>Linear Systems</h2><p>A self-contained, highly motivated and comprehensive account of basic methods for analysis and application of linear systems that arise in signal processing problems in communications, control, system identification and digital filtering.</p><p></p><h2>Sourcework: Academic Writing from Sources, 2nd Edition</h2><p>The second edition of Sourcework, designed to help students make use of outside sources, has been updated and enhanced to better guide writers through the challenges of their first academic research papers.

Some courses included both undergraduate and graduate students and practicing teachers with good success. </p> <p> There is enough material in this book for at least a full year (two semesters) of study under normal conditions, even if only about half of the problems are assigned. With a few exceptions, the chapters are relatively independent and an instructor may choose from them. However, some chapters contain more sophisticated content than others. Here are four possible sequences for a full semester's work: </p> <ul> <li>Algebra emphasis: Chapters 1-6</li> <li>Geometry emphasis: Chapters 1, 7-11</li> <li>Introductory emphasis: Chapters 1, 3, 4, 7, 8,10</li> <li>More advanced emphasis: Chapters 1, 2, 5, 6, 9,11.</li> </ul> <p> In each sequence we suggest beginning with Chapter 1 so that students are aware of the features of this book and of some of the differences between it and other mathematics texts they may have used. More information and suggestions in this regard can be found in the Instructor's Notes. Additional instructional resources are also at the web site <b>http://www.prenhall.com/usiskin</b> . </p> <p> The presentation assumes the student has had at least one year of calculus and a post-calculus mathematics course (such as real analysis, linear algebra, or abstract algebra) in which proofs were required and algebraic structures were discussed. The term "from an advanced standpoint" is taken to mean that the text examines high school mathematical ideas from a perspective appropriate for college mathematics majors, and makes use of the kind of mathematical knowledge and sophistication the student is gaining or has gained in other courses. </p> <p> Two basic characteristics of <i>Mathematics for High School Teachers&#x2013;An Advanced Perspective,</i> taken together, distinguish courses taught from this book from many current courses. First, the material is rooted in the core mathematical content and problems of high school mathematics courses before calculus. Specifically, the development emanates from the major concepts found in high school mathematics: numbers, algebra, geometry, and functions. Second, the concepts and problems are treated from a mathematically advanced standpoint, and differ considerably from materials designed for high school students. </p> <p> The authors feel that the mathematical content in this book lies in an area of mathematics that is of great benefit to all those interested in mathematics at the secondary school level, but is rarely seen by them. Specifically, we have endeavored to include: </p> <ol> <li>analyses of alternate definitions, language, and approaches to mathematical ideas</li> <li>extensions and generalizations of familiar theorems</li> <li>discussions of the historical contexts in which concepts arose and have changed over time</li> <li>applications of the mathematics in a wide range of settings</li> <li>analyses of common problems of high school mathematics from a deeper mathematical level</li> <li>demonstrations of alternate ways of approaching problems, including ways with and without calculator and computer technology</li> <li>connections between ideas that may have been studied separately in different courses</li> <li>relationships of ideas studied in school to ideas students may encounter in later study.</li> </ol> <p> There are many reasons why we believe a teacher or other person interested in high school mathematics should have this knowledge. Mere are a few. Knowing alternate approaches helps in making decisions regarding curriculum, selection of materials, and lesson plans. Being able to connect, extend, and relate mathematical ideas to each other and to the mathematics a student may take later helps in designing courses and responding to student questions. Having a sense of history and the stories behind the mathematics can make lessons more interesting and engaging for both teacher and student. Encountering the richness of the mathematics that is studied at the high school level helps us to understand why some students are turned on by that mathematics, while others have difficulty with it. </p></p><h2>In Real Life</h2><p><p>A NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER</p><p><b>From acclaimed teen author Cory Doctorow and rising star cartoonist Jen Wang, <i>In Real Life</i> is a sensitive, thoughtful look at adolescence, gaming, poverty, and culture-clash.</b></p><p>Anda loves Coarsegold Online, the massively-multiplayer role playing game that she spends most of her free time on. It's a place where she can be a leader, a fighter, a hero. It's a place where she can meet people from all over the world, and make friends. Gaming is, for Anda, entirely a good thing. </p><p>But things become a lot more complicated when Anda befriends a gold farmer -- a poor Chinese kid whose avatar in the game illegally collects valuable objects and then sells them to players from developed countries with money to burn. This behavior is strictly against the rules in Coarsegold, but Anda soon comes to realize that questions of right and wrong are a lot less straightforward when a real person's real livelihood is at stake. </p><br><p><i>This title has common Core connections.</i></p></p><p><p><b>Cory Doctorow</b> is a co-editor of <i>Boing Boing</i> and a columnist for multiple publications including the <i>Guardian</i>, <i>Locus</i>, and <i>Publishers Weekly</i>.

Immediately adept at the game, Anda meets a player who tells her she can make money by killing characters farming for gold. These farmers sell gold to players, allowing them to essentially cheat at the game by quickly buying items they have not earned. Anda meets Raymond, a Chinese teen who works as a gold farmer. She learns about his real life&#x2014;he works long days and has no health coverage. She encourages him to demand health care or strike, a choice that ends up having real-world ramifications. The narrative toggles between the in-game story and real life. The illustrations of the game are vibrant and dynamic, contrasting well with the muted browns and drab greens of Anda's reality. A detailed introduction by Doctorow about games, economics, politics, and activism serves to ensure readers "get" the story. The author attempts to tackle these large issues and others (like gender and privilege) but only does so superficially. The writing can feel heavy-handed, with the message overpowering Anda's voice. The problematic notion of a white character speaking for and trying to save minority characters (that all look identical) is addressed, but the too tidy ending makes that issue, and many others, feel oversimplified. The subject matter will have a built-in audience, and the appealing artwork will move this off the shelves, but readers may ultimately find the story unsatisfying.&#x2014;Amanda MacGregor, formerly at Apollo High School Library, St. Cloud, MN</p><h2>The Hundred Days</h2><p>Patrick O&#39;Brian&#39;s Aubrey-Maturin tales are widely acknowledged to be the greatest series of historical novels ever written. To commemorate the 40th anniversary of their beginning, with Master and Commander, these evocative stories are being re-issued in paperback with smart new livery. This is the nineteenth book in the series. Following the extraordinary success of The Yellow Admiral, this latest Aubrey-Maturin novel brings alive the sights and sounds of North Africa as well as the great naval battles in the days immediately following Napoleon&#39;s escape from Elba. Aubrey and Maturin are in the thick of the plots and counterplots to prevent his regaining power. Coloured by conspiracies in the Adriatic, in the Berber and Arab lands of the southern shores of the Mediterranean, by night actions, fierce pursuits, slave-trading and lion hunts, The Hundred Days is a masterpiece. &#39;O&#39;Brian is far and away the best of the Napoleonic storytellers and The Hundred Days is one of the best of the series: a classic naval adventure, crammed with incident, superbly plotted and utterly gripping!This is O&#39;Brian at his brilliant, entertaining best and when he is on this form the rest of us who write of the Napoleonic conflict might as well give up and try a new career. Fans of the series will need no encouragement to buy this book, but if you are new to Aubrey and Maturin then this is as splendid an introduction as you could wish for.&#39; Bernard Cornwell</p><p>The year is 1815, and Europe's most unpopular (not to mention tiniest) empire-builder has escaped from Elba. In <i>The Hundred Days</i>, it's up to Jack Aubrey--and surgeon-cum-spymaster Stephen Maturin--to stop Napoleon in his tracks. How? For starters, Aubrey and his squadron have been dispatched to the Adriatic coast, to keep Bonapartist shipbuilders from beefing up the French navy. Meanwhile, one Sheik Ibn Hazm is fomenting an Islamic uprising against the Allies. The only way to halt this maneuver is to intercept the sheik's shipment of gold--because in the Napoleonic era, as in our own, even the most ardent of mercenaries requires a salary. <p> <i>The Hundred Days</i> is the 19th (and, we are told, the penultimate) installment of O'Brian's epic. Like many of its predecessors, it features a fairly swashbuckling plot, complete with cannon fire, exotic disguises, and Aubrey's suspenseful, slow-motion pursuit of an Algerian <i>xebek</i>. Yet it never turns into a mere exercise in Hornblowerism. Partly this is due to O'Brian's delicate touch with character--the relationship between extroverted Aubrey and introverted Maturin has deepened with each book, and even Aubrey's reunion with his childhood companion Queenie Keith is full of novelistic nuance: "They sat smiling at one another. An odd pair: handsome creatures both, but they might have been of the same sex or neither." Nor does the author focus too exclusively on his dynamic duo. Indeed, <i>The Hundred Days</i> is very much a chronicle of a floating <i>community</i>, which Maturin describes as "his own village, his own ship's company, that complex entity so much more easily sensed than described: part of his natural habitat." </p><p> Finally, O'Brian shows his usual expertise in balancing the great events with the most minuscule ones. Other authors have written about battles at sea, and still others have recorded the rapid rise and fall of Napoleon's fortunes after his escape from confinement. But who else would give equal time--and an equal charge of delight--to Maturin's discovery of an anomalous nuthatch? <i>--James Marcus</i></p>7 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</h2><p>The Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus first appeared in 1921 and was the only philosophical work that Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951) published during his lifetime. Written in short, carefully numbered paragraphs of extreme compression and brilliance, it immediately convinced many of its readers and captivated the imagination of all. Its chief influence, at first, was on the Logical Positivists of the 1920s and 30s, but many other philosophers were stimulated by its philosophy of language, finding attractive, if ultimately unsatisfactory, its view that propositions were pictures of reality. Perhaps most of all, Wittgenstein himself, after his return to philosophy in the late 1920s, was fascinated by its vision of an inexpressible, crystalline world of logical relationships. The posthumous publication of other writings has, therefore, only served to reawaken interest in the Tractatus and to illuminate its more neglected aspects. In this present edition Mr. Pears and Mr. McGuinness have been able to revise their translation in the light of Wittgenstein&#39;s own suggestions and comments in his correspondence wit hC. K. Ogden about the first translation.</p><p>Ludwig Josef Johann Wittgenstein (1889&#x2013;1951) was an Austrian philosopher who held the professorship in philosophy at the University of Cambridge from 1939 until 1947. He is known for having inspired two of the century's principal philosophical movements, logical positivism and ordinary language philosophy, though in his lifetime he published just one book review, one article, a children's dictionary, and the 75-page Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1921). In 1999 his posthumously published Philosophical Investigations (1953) was ranked as the most important book of 20th-century philosophy. Born into one of Austria-Hungary's wealthiest families in Vienna at the turn of the century, he gave away his inheritance, and was at one point forced to sell his furniture to cover expenses when working on the Tractatus. Three of his brothers committed suicide, with Wittgenstein and the remaining brother contemplating it too. Bertrand Russell described him as the most perfect example of genius, "passionate, profound, intense, and dominating", while Richard Rorty wrote that he took out his intense self-loathing on everyone he met. He grew angry when his students wanted to teach philosophy, and was famously overjoyed when G.E. Moore's wife told him she was working in a jam factory&#x2014;doing something useful, in Wittgenstein's eyes. He tried to leave philosophy himself several times, serving during the First World War on the front lines with the Austrian Army, and commended for his courage; teaching in schools in Austrian villages, where he found himself in trouble for hitting the children; and working during the Second World War as an orderly in Guy's Hospital, London, where only a few of the staff were told that the new porter was the professor of philosophy at Cambridge.</p><h2>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin: A Norton Critical Edition (Norton Critical Editions)</h2><p><p><strong><em>&#x201c;Elizabeth Ammons has produced a first-rate Norton Critical Edition with</em> Uncle Tom&#x2019;s Cabin<em>.&#x201d;</em> &#x2015;Mason I.

It also informs the practitioner about the underlying strength or weakness of the patient&#x2019;s constitution. <p>This atlas contains over 320 color photographs of tongues seen in a Western clinic. The photographs provide a graphic representation of a wide variety of common disorders. Each photograph is accompanied by a description of the significant features of the tongue, the corresponding Chinese diagnosis for each such feature, accompanying symptoms, Western diagnosis, and pertinent background information. </p><p>The presentation of the tongues is organized according to the nature of the underlying disharmony: Lung, Spleen-Stomach, Kidney, Heart, Liver. Other chapters focus on particular aspects of the tongue, such as pale tongues, cracked tongues, special coating, as well as those associated with heat disorders and blood stasis. The text is interspersed with many full case histories that describe aspects that are not visible on the tongue alone. </p><p>A final chapter surveys several cases which reflect how the tongue changed over the course of treatment, with before and after photographs. This systematic presentation provides the student and practitioner of Chinese medicine with a much deeper appreciation for the methodology of tongue diagnosis in Chinese medicine. </p><p>An extensive and detailed index provides access to virtually every aspect of the hundreds of tongues presented in this atlas, and their interrelationships.</p></p><p>Barbara Kirschbaum received her Bachelor of Acupuncture at the International College of Oriental Medicine (England) in 1980, where she taught for seven years, and has pursued additional studies at various TCM hospitals in China over the past two decades.

Peaking in the war's final three months, it was the first air attack of its kind. Civilian dwellings were struck by-in today's terms-"weapons of mass destruction," with a total of 600,000 casualties, including 70,000 children.<br><br>In <i>The Fire</i>, historian J�rg Friedrich explores this crucial chapter in military and world history. Combining meticulous research with striking illustrations, Friedrich presents a vivid account of the saturation bombing, rendering in acute detail the annihilation of cities such as Dresden, the jewel of Germany's rich art and architectural heritage. He incorporates the personal stories and firsthand testimony of German civilians into his narrative, creating a macabre portrait of unimaginable suffering, horror, and grief, and he draws on official military documents to unravel the reasoning behind the strikes. <br><br>Evolving military technologies made the extermination of whole cities possible, but owing, perhaps, to the Allied victory and what W. G. Sebald noted as "a pre-conscious self-censorship, a way of obscuring a world that could no longer be presented in comprehensible terms," the wisdom of this strategy has never been questioned. <i>The Fire</i> is a rare account of the air raids as they were experienced by the civilians who were their targets.</p><p>Combining meticulous research with striking descriptions, J�rg Friedrich renders in acute detail the Allies&#39; air campaign of systematic destruction of civilian life, cultural treasures, and industrial capacities in Germany&#39;s city landscape.

He also draws on official military documents to unravel the reasoning behind the Allies&#39; strikes.J�rg Friedrich was born in Tyrolia in 1944 and grew up in the Ruhr District (Essen). A broadcaster in Berlin, Friedrich became a historian after he reported on the Majdanek Trial during the 1970s. His first comprehensive history of the prosecution of Nazi criminals in Germany, <i>The Cold Amnesty</i> (1984), was a bestseller in the Federal Republic. In 1993 he published a monograph on the forgotten Nuremberg Trial of the German High Command titled <i>The Law of War: The German Army in Russia</i>, which earned him a honorary doctorate from the University of Amsterdam. The idea for <i>The Fire</i> came to Friedrich accidentally one night in February 2002, and since its publication, the book has been translated into ten languages, sparking debate worldwide.<br> J�rg Friedrich was born in Essen, Germany, in 1944 and spent most of his career writing about Nazi atrocities before orienting his research toward an analysis of Allied military tactics.

The Tales gathers twenty-nine of literature&#x2019;s most enduring (and endearing) characters in a vivid group portrait that captures the full spectrum of medieval society, from the exalted Knight to the humble Plowman. <br><br>This new edition includes a comprehensive introduction that summarizes some of the most important historical events and movements that defined the world of Chaucer and his pilgrims; two additional tales (Reeve&#x2019;s and Shipman&#x2019;s); introductions for each tale designed to prepare the reader for a better understanding and enjoyment of the tale; newly written and conveniently placed explanatory notes; and a new, more easily understood system for learning to pronounce Chaucerian Middle English.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p>On a spring day in April--sometime in the waning years of the 14th century--29 travelers set out for Canterbury on a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Thomas Beckett. Among them is a knight, a monk, a prioress, a plowman, a miller, a merchant, a clerk, and an oft-widowed wife from Bath. Travel is arduous and wearing; to maintain their spirits, this band of pilgrims entertains each other with a series of tall tales that span the spectrum of literary genres. Five hundred years later, people are still reading Geoffrey Chaucer's <i>Canterbury Tales</i>. If you haven't yet made the acquaintance of the Franklin, the Pardoner, or the Squire because you never learned Middle English, take heart: this edition of the <i>Tales</i> has been translated into modern idiom. <p> From the heroic romance of "The Knight's Tale" to the low farce embodied in the stories of the Miller, the Reeve, and the Merchant, Chaucer treated such universal subjects as love, sex, and death in poetry that is simultaneously witty, insightful, and poignant. <i>The Canterbury Tales</i> is a grand tour of 14th-century English mores and morals--one that modern-day readers will enjoy.</p>This textbook series provides concise and lucid introductions to major works of literature, from classical antiquity to the twentieth century.

When he awoke, he told friends and family of his ascension to Indian heaven, where his grandfather had given him a warning: "Beware of the religion of the white man: every Indian who embraces it is obliged to take the road to the white man's heaven; and yet no red man is permitted to enter there, but will have to wander about forever without a resting place."</p><p>The events leading to this vision are the subject of <i>A Spirited Resistance</i>, the poignant story of the Indian movement to challenge Anglo-American expansionism. Departing from the traditional confines of the history of American Indians, Gregory Evans Dowd carefully draws on ethnographic sources to recapture the beliefs, thoughts, and actions of four principal Indian nations&#x2015;Delaware, Shawnee, Cherokee, and Creek. The result is a sensitive portrayal of the militant Indians&#x2015;often led by prophets&#x2015;who came to conceive of themselves as a united people, and launched an intertribal campaign to resist the Anglo-American forces.</p><p>Dowd also uncovers the Native American opposition to the movement for unity. That opposition, he finds, was usually the result of divisions within Indian communities rather than intertribal rivalry. In fact, Dowd argues, intertribal enmity had little to do with the ultimate failure of the Indian struggle; it was division within Indian communities, colonial influence on Indian government, and the sheer force of the Anglo-American campaign that brought the Indian resistance movement to an end. An evocative history of long frustration and ultimate failure, <i>A Spirited Resistance</i> tells of a creative people, whose insights, magic, and ritual add a much-needed dimension to our understanding of the American Indian.</p></p><p>Departing from the traditional confines of the history of American Indians, Gregory Evans Dowd carefully draws on ethnographic sources to recapture the beliefs, thoughts, and actions of four principal Indian nations -- Delaware, Shawnee, Cherokee, and Creek.

And as Leon R. Kass shows in <i>The Beginning of Wisdom</i>, it&#x2019;s also timeless. <br><br>Examining Genesis in a philosophical light, Kass presents it not as a story of what happened long ago, but as the enduring story of humanity itself. He asserts that the first half of Genesis contains insights about human nature that &#x201c;rival anything produced by the great philosophers.&#x201d; Kass here reads these first stories&#x2014;from Adam and Eve to the tower of Babel&#x2014;as a mirror for self-discovery that reveals truths about human reason, speech, freedom, sexual desire, pride, shame, anger, and death. Taking a step further in the second half of his book, Kass explores the struggles in Genesis to launch a new way of life that addresses mankind&#x2019;s morally ambiguous nature by promoting righteousness and holiness. <br><br>Even readers who don&#x2019;t agree with Kass&#x2019;s interpretations will find <i>The Beginning of Wisdom</i> a<i></i>compelling book&#x2014;a masterful philosophical take on one of the world&#x2019;s seminal religious texts. <br><br>&#x201c;Extraordinary. . . .

A member of the President&#x2019;s Council on Bioethics, he is the author or coauthor of five books, including, most recently, <i>Life, </i><i>Liberty</i><i> and the Defense of Dignity: The Challenge for Bioethics</i>.*Starred Review* Unlike the many devout readers who approach the Bible to find salvation, unlike even the secular scholars who take up the Bible to advance linguistic and historical understanding, Kass comes to Genesis in pursuit of philosophical wisdom. And he finds it. As a distinguished researcher in molecular biology and bioethics, Kass well understands how modern science has rendered untenable many traditional readings of the holy book. But he also recognizes how scientific expertise has created dilemmas demanding anew the kind of moral insights that generations have gleaned from Scripture. And though he demurs as to its divine inspiration, Kass finds in Genesis a richly rewarding narrative challenging readers to explore the promise and peril of human life. Unfolding a unified series of pedagogical investigations (developed over two decades of teaching the text at the University of Chicago), Kass guides readers in profound reflections on natural and human origins: How did Eden's forbidden fruit deliver Adam and Eve to death yet simultaneously endow them with spiritual freedom? How did the failure of the Tower of Babel expose the limits of civilization--including our own? Kass must ask different questions once Abraham appears (in Genesis 12), for his covenantal relationship with deity transcends philosophic reasoning. Yet in limning the rise of the Israelite nation, Kass probes the meaning--and contemporary significance--of a communal commitment to reverence and justice. Readers unattached to church or synagogue may be surprised at how much the Bible still has to teach them. <i>Bryce Christensen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Is it a work of nihilistic despair, &#34;a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing&#34;, or is it a cautionary tale warning of the dangers of Machiavellianism and relativism? Does it lead to hell and hopelessness, or does it point to a light beyond the darkness? This critical edition of Shakespeare&#39;s classic psychological drama contains essays by some of today&#39;s leading critics, exploring Macbeth as a morality play, as a history play with contemporary relevance, and as a drama that shows a vision of evil and that grapples with the problem of free will.</p><p>He is the author of many acclaimed biographies of major Christian literary figures.

This controversial book is the first to present a unified theory of human mating behavior. <i>The Evolution of Desire </i> is based on the most massive study of human mating ever undertaken, encompassing more than 10,000 peoples of all ages from thirty-seven cultures worldwide. If we all want love, why is there so much conflict in our most cherished relationships? To answer this question, we must look into our evolutionary past, according to David M. Buss. For in attracting, keeping, and even breaking up with our mates, we are closer to our ancestral forebears than many of us think.</p><p>David M. Buss is Professor of Psychology at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.In a study involving over 10,000 people from 37 cultures, Buss (Psychology/Univ. of Michigan) uses evolutionary theory to explain the psychological mechanisms behind how and why people choose, keep, and discard their mates. Mating, according to Buss, is not a sentimental or humane activity: it is, rather, as competitive, conflictual, and manipulative on the human level as it is among the insects. To provide for themselves and their offspring, women seek providers- -men with money, power, maturity, ambition, stability, commitment, health, and cooperative natures. Men, for similar reasons, invest their time, resources, and sperm in young, beautiful, and fertile women who will give them heirs and status. At the same time they retain a primitive ability for casual sex as well--a sexual mechanism that is less selective and can be satisfied in more primitive ways such as fantasy, homosexuality, and incest. The capacity for multiple partners, casual sex, jealousy (a series of protective responses), and divorce are all adaptive mechanisms to help people--though mostly men--achieve their reproductive potential. Detailed analysis of various forms of mating rituals considered in large anthropological and biological contexts explain adaptive techniques for attracting and keeping mates and what happens when they get out of hand, ancestral instincts becoming destructive (abuse and rape). Scientifically rigorous, the study, on a human level, is abstract and statistical (75 societies reported infertility as a cause of conjugal dissolution); the detail is found on the animal level, as in a lurid scene of mating between scorpion flies. However incomplete sociobiology and evolutionary psychology may be in explaining human relationships, they clearly affirm the value of raising the instinctual to the level of consciousness and the miracle, as Buss eloquently concludes, of modern marriage as a ``crowning achievement of humankind.'' -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The matter of his death was sudden, violent and unpremiditated, and there were some who argue that he killed himself because he was tormented by guilt - guilt that he had survived the horrors of Auschwitz while others, better than he, had gone to the wall. THE DROWNED AND THE SAVED is Levi&#39;s impassioned attempt to understand the &#39;rationale&#39; behind the concentration camps, was completed shortly before his tragic death in 1987. THE DROWNED AND THE SAVED dispels the myth that Primo Levi forgave the Germans for what they did to his people. He didn&#39;t and couldn&#39;t forgive. He refused, however, to indulge in what he called &#39;the bestial vice of hatred&#39; which is an entirely different matter. The voice that sounds in his writing is that of a reasonable man...it warns and reminds us that the unimaginable can happen again. A would-be tyrant is waiting in the wings, with &#39;beautiful words&#39; on his lips. The book is constantly impressing on us the need to learn from the past, to make sense of the senseless&#39; PAUL BAILEY</p><p>This book, published months after Italian writer Primo Levi's suicide in 1987, is a small but powerful look at Auschwitz, the hell where Levi was imprisoned during World War II. The book was his third on the subject, following <i>Survival in Auschwitz</i> (1947) and <i>The Reawakening</i> (1963). Removed from the experience by time and age, Levi chose to serve more as an observer of the camp than the passionate young man of his previous work. He writes of "useless violence" inflicted by the guards on prisoners and then concludes the book with a discussion of the Germans who have written to him about their complicity in the event. In all, he tries to make sense of something that--as he knew--made no sense at all.Levi wrote of the moral collapse that occurred in Auschwitz and the fallibility of human memory that allows such atrocities to recur. Levi&#39;s last book published before his death in 1987.</p><h2>Water: The Epic Struggle for Wealth, Power, and Civilization</h2><p><p>&#x201c;I read this wide-ranging and thoughtful book while sitting on the banks of the Ganges near Varanasi&#x2014;it's a river already badly polluted, and now threatened by the melting of the loss of the glaciers at its source to global warming. Four hundred million people depend on it, and there's no backup plan. As Steven Solomon makes clear, the same is true the world over; this volume will give you the background to understand the forces that will drive much of 21st century history.&#x201d; &#x2014;Bill McKibben </p><p>In <em>Water</em>, esteemed journalist Steven Solomon describes a terrifying&#x2014;and all too real&#x2014;world in which access to fresh water has replaced oil as the primary cause of global conflicts that increasingly emanate from drought-ridden, overpopulated areas of the world. Meticulously researched and undeniably prescient, <em>Water</em> is a stunningly clear-eyed action statement on what Robert F Kennedy, Jr. calls &#x201c;the biggest environmental and political challenge of our time.&#x201d;</p></p><p><p>Far more than oil, the control of water wealth throughout history has been pivotal to the rise and fall of great powers, the achievements of civilization, the transformations of society's vital habitats, and the quality of ordinary daily lives. In Water, Steven Solomon offers the first-ever narrative portrait of the power struggles, personalities, and breakthroughs that have shaped humanity from antiquity's earliest civilizations, the Roman Empire, medieval China, and Islam's golden age to Europe's rise, the steam-powered Industrial Revolution, and America's century. Today, freshwater scarcity is one of the twenty-first century's decisive, looming challenges and is driving the new political, economic, and environmental realities across the globe.</p><p>As modern society runs short of its most indispensable resource and the planet's renewable water ecosystems grow depleted, an explosive new fault line is dividing humanity into water Haves and Have-nots. Genocides, epidemic diseases, failed states, and civil warfare increasingly emanate from water-starved, overpopulated parts of Africa and Asia. Water famines threaten to ignite new wars in the bone-dry Middle East. Faltering clean water supplies menace the sustainable growth and ability of China and India to feed themselves. Water scarcity is inseparably interrelated to the global crises of energy, food, and climate change. For Western democracies, water represents no less than the new oil&#x2014;demanding a major rethink of basic domestic and foreign policies&#x2014;but also offering a momentous opportunity to relaunch wealth and global leadership through exploiting a comparative advantage in freshwater reserves. Meticulously researched and masterfully written, Steven Solomon's Water is a groundbreaking account of man's most critical resource in shaping human destinies, from ancient times to our dawning age of water scarcity.</p><p>Steven Solomon is a journalist who has written for <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>BusinessWeek</em>, <em>The Economist</em>, <em>Forbes</em>, and <em>Esquire</em>, and has commented on NPR's <em>Marketplace</em>.

Hafen offers hope by teaching that the Savior&#39;s victory can compensate not only for our sins, &#34;but also for our inadequacies; not only for our deliberate mistakes, but also for sin committed in ignorance, our errors of judgment, and our unavoidable imperfections.&#34; The Broken Heart shows how the Atonement is the ultimate source of our forgiveness, our perfection, our peace of mind.</p><p>Elder Bruce C. Hafen, a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy since 1996, has served in several Area Presidencies. He has been president of Ricks College, dean of the J.

Although 36 was the highway that ran across the mountains from Red Bluff to Fortuna, it was mostly two lane. She put her cherry-red Jeep SUV in Park and stepped out of the vehicle. The rain had finally stopped, giving way to a bright summer sun, but the road was wet and splattered with muddy puddles. She peered way up the road to see a man wearing a bright orange vest holding a stop sign toward a long string of cars, closing both lanes. The turnoff to her Uncle Walt's would be on the other side of the next hill.<br><br>She picked her way around puddles to the truck parked in front of her, intending to ask the driver if he knew what was going on. When she got to the driver's window she smiled. "Well, hey, Doc."<br><br>Doc Mullins looked out the open window. "Hey, yourself, little girl. Up here for a weekend of riding?" he asked with his usual grumpy tone.<br><br>"Not this time, Doc. I sold my mother's house in Bodega Bay," she said. "Packed up the bare essentials and am moving in with Uncle Walt for a while."<br><br>"Permanently?"<br><br>"Nah. For a few months, though. I'm still in transition."<br><br>Doc's grimace melted slightly, but only slightly. "Once again, condolences on your loss, Shelby," he said. "I hope you're doing all right with that."<br><br>"Better all the time, thanks. My mom was ready to go." She tilted her head up the road. "Have any idea what's holding us up here?"<br><br>"Soft shoulder gave out," he said. "I passed it on my way to Valley Hospital. Dumped half this lane down the hill. They're repairing."<br><br>"Guardrails would be nice," she observed.<br><br>"Only around the tight curves," he said. "On a straightaway like this, we're on our own. Damn lucky a car or truck didn't go with that soft shoulder. It's going to be like this the next few days."<br><br>"Once I get to Walt's, I'm not planning to be on this road again, for a while anyway," she said with a shrug.<br><br>"What <em>are </em>you planning, if I might ask?" Doc said, lifting one of his bushy eyebrows.<br><br>"Well, while I'm visiting the family, I'll be making applications to schools. Nursing," she said with a smile. "A fairly obvious choice for me after taking care of my mother for years."<br><br>"Ach, just what I need," he said with his usual scowl. "Another nurse. Drive me to drink."<br><br>She laughed at him. "At least we won't have to drive you far."<br><br>"There's just what I mean. Another impertinent one, at that," he clarified.<br><br>She laughed again, loving this ornery old guy. Shelby turned, Doc leaned out of his window and both of them watched a man approach from the truck that had stopped behind Shelby's Jeep. He walked toward them. His hair was shaved down in that military fashion she'd been accustomed to all her life; her uncle was a retired army general. A black T-shirt was stretched tight over broad, hard shoulders, his waist narrow, his hips slim and legs long. But what fascinated her was the way he came toward them, with an economy of movement. Deliberate. Confident. <em>Cocky. </em>His thumbs were hooked into front pockets and he sauntered. When he got closer, she could see his very slight smile as he looked at her, or looked her over, to be more precise. Sizing her up with glowing eyes. <em>In your dreams, </em>she thought, which caused her to smile back.<br><br>As he passed her Jeep, he glanced inside at all the packed-up boxes, then continued to where she was standing beside Doc's open window. "That yours?" he asked, jutting his chin toward the Jeep.<br><br>"Yup."<br><br>"Where are you headed?" he asked.<br><br>"Virgin River. You?"<br><br>"The same." He grinned. "Any idea what's going on up there?"<br><br>"Collapsed shoulder," Doc said with a grunt. "They have us down to one lane for repairs. What's your business in Virgin River?"<br><br>"I have some old cabins along the river there." He glanced between them. "You two live in the town?" he asked.<br><br>"I have family there," Shelby said. She stuck out her hand. "I'm Shelby."<br><br>He took her small hand. "Luke. Luke Riordan." He turned toward Doc, putting out his hand again. "Sir?"<br><br>Doc didn't extend a hand, but rather gave a nod. His hands were so twisted with arthritis, he never risked a handshake. "Mullins," he said.<br><br>"Doc Mullins has lived in Virgin River all his life. He's the town doctor," Shelby explained to Luke.<br><br>"Nice to meet you, sir," Luke said.<br><br>"Another jarhead?" Doc asked, lifting one white, spiking eyebrow.<br><br>Luke straightened. "I beg your pardon," he said. "Army. Sir." Then he looked at Shelby. <em>"Another </em>marine?"<br><br>"A few of our friends who work in town are marines. Retired or discharged. Their friends come around sometimes&#x2014;some of them are still active or in the reserves," she explained. "But my uncle, who I'll be living with for a while, was Army. Retired." She grinned. "You won't stand out that much with your hairdo. I don't know what it is with you guys and the buzz cuts."<br><br>He smiled patiently. "We've never been checked out on those dryer things."<br><br>"Ah. Blow-dryers. Right."<br><br>As they waited in their stalled lane, the second lane was opened up to let a big yellow school bus pass. Judging by the number of vehicles waiting in their lane, they weren't going anywhere anytime soon, so there was no great rush to get back to their cars. They remained standing on the road, which ended up being a big mistake for Luke. As he saw the bus barreling down the other lane, Luke also noted a sizable puddle in front of it. He quickly put himself between Shelby and the bus, pressing her up against Doc's open window. With a hand on each side of her, he covered her with his body, barely in time to feel the splat from the puddle against his back.<br><br>Shelby stifled a chuckle. Macho man, she thought with some humor.<br><br>Luke heard downshifting, then the squeal of brakes. "Jesus," he muttered as he backed off the girl and glared after the bus.<br><br>As Luke turned and scowled at the bus, the driver leaned out the window. A round-faced woman in her fifties, rosy cheeked with a cap of short dark hair, grinned at him. She <em>grinned! </em>"Sorry, buddy," she said. "Couldn't hardly help that."<br><br>"You could if you went a lot slower," he yelled back at her.<br><br>To his astonishment, she laughed. "Aw, I wasn't going too fast. I got a schedule, y'know," she yelled. "My advice? Stay out of the way."<br><br>His scalp felt hot under his short hair and he really wanted to swear. When he turned back to Shelby and Doc, he found her smiling behind her hand and Doc's eyes twinkling. "You got a little splatter on your back there, Luke," she said, trying to keep control of her lips.<br><br>Doc's face was the same&#x2014;cranky and impatient, but for the glittering eyes. "Molly's been slinging that big yellow tube around these mountains for thirty years now, and ain't nobody knows these roads better. Guess she didn't see a pothole this once."<br><br>"It's not even September yet!" Luke protested.<br><br>"She drives year-round," Doc said. "Summer school, special programs, athletics. Always something going on. She's a saint&#x2014;you couldn't pay me enough to do that job. What's a mud puddle here and there?" Then the old doctor put his truck noisily in gear. "Our turn coming up."<br><br>Shelby jogged back toward her Jeep. Luke started to walk back toward his truck, which pulled a camper. Then he heard Doc, shouting at his back, "Welcome to Virgin River, son. Enjoy yourself." And it was followed by a cackle.<br><br>* * *<br><br>Shelby McIntyre had been fixing up her deceased mother's house for months, but she'd been able to drive up to Virgin River from Bodega Bay nearly every weekend through the summer to ride. And her Uncle Walt had paid many a visit to her to oversee renovation work that he'd personally contracted. By the end of summer Shelby had roses on her cheeks. She had rolled up her shorts and her legs were tanned. Her thighs and butt had developed firm riding muscles and her eyes sparkled with health. It had been years since she'd benefited from that type of regular exercise.<br><br>But when she pulled up in front of Walt's house now, in mid-August, it was a completely different feeling. The house was sold, her belongings were in the back of her Jeep, and at the age of twenty-five, she was embarking on a brand-new life. She gave the horn a toot, got out of her Jeep and stretched. In just moments, Uncle Walt came out the front door, stood there with his hands on his hips, a big grin on his face. "Welcome back," he said. "Or should I say, welcome home?"<br><br>"Hey there," she said, walking into his arms. Walt was six feet with thick, silver hair, dark bushy brows and shoulders and arms like a wrestler's. He was a powerfully built man for just over sixty.<br><br>He hugged her tight. "I was just about to go to the stable and saddle up. You too tired? You hungry or anything?"<br><br>"I'm dying to get on a horse, but I think I'll pass after riding in a Jeep for over four hours," she said.<br><br>He laughed. "Backside pretty well broken in?"<br><br>"Ohhh," she said, rubbing her butt.<br><br>"I'm just riding down along the river for an hour or so. Vanni's down at the new construction, getting in Paul's business, but she's going to be back in time to cook you a nice welcome-home dinner."<br><br>Shelby looked at her watch. It was only three-thirty. "Tell you what&#x2014;I'm going to run into town while you go for your ride and Vanni inspects her new house. I'll say hi to Mel Sheridan and see if I can talk her into a beer to celebrate my change of residence. I'll be back in time to help with the horses before dinner. Should I get this stuff out of the Jeep first? Take it inside?" she asked.<br><br>"Honey, leave it be, no one's gonna bother it. Paul and I will unload you before supper."<br><br>She grinned at him. "Let's make a date for tomorrow morning. We'll have that ride together."<br><br>"Good deal. No trouble closing on the house?"<br><br>"It was a little more emotional than I expected. I thought I was ready."<br><br>"Regrets?"<br><br>She turned her large hazel eyes up to his face. "I cried for the first fifty miles," she said. "And then I started to get excited. I'm sure about this."<br><br>"Good," he said, giving her a squeeze. "I'm so glad you're here."<br><br>"Just for a few months. Then I'm going to travel a little and get a head start on school. It's been so long since I've been a student."<br><br>"Life here is usually pretty laid-back. Take advantage of it."<br><br>"Yeah&#x2014;" she laughed "&#x2014;when you're not having shoot-outs or forest fires."<br><br>"Well, hell, girl, we want to keep things interesting!" He walked her to her Jeep.<br><br>"Wait for me to get back to muck the stalls and feed the horses."<br><br>"Enjoy a little girlfriend time," he said. "It's something you haven't had enough of the past few years. You'll have plenty of horseshit to muck while you're here."<br><br>"Thanks, Uncle Walt," she said and laughed. "I won't be too long."<br><br>He kissed her forehead. "I said, take your time. You took good care of my sister. You've earned piles of it."<br><br>"See you in a couple of hours," Shelby said, heading for town.<br><br>Luke Riordan pulled into Virgin River, his Harley strapped into the back of his extended-cab truck, pulling his small camper. It had been seven years since he'd seen this town and there had been a few changes. The church was now boarded up, but what he remembered as an old, abandoned cabin in the center of town was renovated, had cars and trucks parked around the front porch, and an Open sign in the window. It looked like some construction was under way behind the cabin; it was framed for an add-on. Since he was considering a renovation project of his own, he wouldn't mind having a look at what had been done to this place. He parked off to the side, out of the way, and got out of the truck. He went into the camper and changed out of his muddy shirt before going inside.<br><br>The August afternoon was warm, with a cool, refreshing breeze; the night would be chilly in the mountains. He hadn't been out to the house he planned to live in, which had been vacant for a year. If it was uninhabitable, he had his camper. He took a deep breath. The air was so damn clean, it stung the lungs. Such a huge change from the deserts of Iraq and El Paso. Just what he'd been needing.<br><br>He walked into the renovated cabin and found himself in a good-looking little country bar. He stood just inside the door and looked around appreciatively. The hardwood floors gleamed, hot embers glowed in the hearth, hunting and fishing trophies hung mounted on the walls. There were about a dozen tables and a long, shiny bar behind which there were shelves full of liquor and glasses surrounding a stuffed king salmon that must have weighed about forty pounds at the catch. A television, mounted high in a corner, was tuned to national news, the volume turned down. A couple of fishermen, identifiable by their khaki vests and hats, sat at one end of the bar playing cribbage. A few men in work shirts and jeans were having drinks at a nearby table. Luke looked at his watch: 4:00 p.m. He walked up to the bar.<br><br>"What can I get you?" the bartender asked.<br><br>"A cold draft, thanks. This place wasn't here the last time I was through town."<br><br>"You've been away a while then. I've been open more than four years now. I bought it and turned it into this."<br><br>"Well, you did a helluva job," he said, accepting the beer. "I'm going to be doing some remodeling myself." He stuck out his hand. "Luke Riordan," he said.<br><br>"Jack Sheridan. Pleasure."<br><br>"I bought some old cabins along the Virgin that have been sitting empty and going downhill for years now."<br><br>"Those old Chapman cabins?" Jack asked. "The old man died just last year."<br><br>"Yeah, I know," Luke said. "I was back here hunting with one of my brothers and a couple of friends when we first saw them. My brother and I thought the location, right on the river, might be worth some money. We noticed the cabins weren't in use and wanted to buy 'em and fix 'em up for a quick resale, turn 'em fast and make a couple of bucks. But old Chapman wouldn't even listen to an offer...."<br><br></p><h2>Everworld #11: Mystify The Magician</h2><p>Christopher, Jalil, April, David, and Senna escape from Atlantis to the island of Eire, a land out of Irish legends, where they discover that Merlin is getting closer, and that he will not stop his pursuit of Senna.</p><p></p><h2>LEGO NINJAGO: Character Encyclopedia</h2><p><p>Contains an EXCLUSIVE minifigure for you to put together!</p> <p>Sensei Wu's ninjas may work together, but they are actually all very different and unique.

She died in 1992.</p>CHAPTER 1 &nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guido Morris and Vincent Cardworthy were third cousins. No one remembered which Morris had married which Cardworthy, and no one cared except at large family gatherings when this topic was introduced and subjected to the benign opinions of all. Vincent and Guido had been friends since babyhood. They had been strolled together in the same pram and as boys were often brought together, either at the Cardworthy house in Petrie, Connecticut, or at the Morris's in Boston to play marbles, climb trees, and set off cherry bombs in trash cans and mailboxes. As teenagers, they drank beer in hiding and practiced smoking Guido's father's cigars, which did not make them sick, but happy. As adults, they both loved a good cigar. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At college they fooled around, spent money, and wondered what would become of them when they grew up. Guido in tended to write poetry in heroic couplets and Vincent thought he might eventually win the Nobel Prize for physics. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In their late twenties they found themselves together again in Cambridge. Guido had gone to law school, had put in several years at a Wall Street law firm, and had discovered that his heart was not in his work, and so he had come back to graduate school to study Romance languages and literature. He was old for a graduate student, but he had decided to give himself a few years of useless pleasure before the true responsibilities of adulthood set upon him. Eventually, Guido was to go to New York and take over the stewardship of the Morris family trust-the Magna ,Charta Foundation, which gave money to civic art projects, artists of all sorts, and groups who wished to preserve landmarks and beautify their cities. The trust put out a bimonthly magazine devoted to the arts called Runnymeade. The money for all this came from a small fortune in textiles made in the early nineteenth century by a former sea captain by the name of Robert Morris. On one of his journeys, Robert Morris had married an Italian wife. Thereafter, all Morrises had Italianate names. Guido's grandfather was Almanso. His father was Sandro. His Uncle Giancarlo was the present administrator of the trust but he was getting on and Guido had been chosen to be eventual heir. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vincent had gone off to the University of London and had come back to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He had begun as a city planner, but his true field of interest was sanitation engineering, as it was called, although Vincent called it garbage. He was fascinated by its production, removal, and possible uses. His monographs on recycling, published in a magazine called City Limits, were beginning to make him famous in his field. He had also patented a small machine for home use that turned vegetable peelings, newspapers, and other kitchen leavings into valuable mulch, but nothing much had happened to it. Eventually he would go off to New York and give over his talent and energy to the Board of City Planning. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With their futures somewhat assured, they lolled around Cambridge and wondered whom they would marry. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One Sunday afternoon in January, Vincent and Guido found themselves perusing an exhibition of Greek vases at the Fogg Museum. The air outside was heavy and wet. Inside, it was overheated. It was the sort of day that forced you out of the house and gave you nothing back in return. They had been restless indoors, edgy out of doors, and had settled on the Fogg feeling that the sight of Greek vases might cool them out. They took several turns around. Guido delivered himself of a lecture on shape and form. Vincent gave his two minutes on the planning of the Greek city-state. None of this quieted them. They were looking for action, unsure of what kind and unwilling to seek it out. Vincent believed that the childish desire to kick tires and smash bottles against walls was never lost but relegated, in adulthood, to the subconscious where it jumped around creating just the sort of tension he was feeling. A sweaty round of handball or a couple of well-set cherry bombs would have done them both a lot of good, but it was too cold for the one and they were too refined for the other. Thus they were left with their own nerves. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the way out, Guido saw a girl sitting on a bench. She was slender, fine-boned, and her hair was the blackest, sleekest hair Guido had ever seen. It was worn the way Japanese children wear theirs, only longer. Her face seemed to print itself on his heart indelibly. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stopped to stare at her and when she finally looked back, she glared through him. Guido nudged Vincent and they moved toward the bench on which she sat. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;The perspective is perfect," said Guido. &#x201c;Notice the subtlety of line and the intensity of color." <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Very painterly," said Vincent. &#x201c;What is it?" <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I'll have to look it up," said Guido. &#x201c;It appears to be an inspired mix of schools. Notice that the nose tilts-a very slight distortion giving the illusion of perfect clarity." He pointed to her collar. &#x201c;Note the exquisite folds around the neck and the drapery of the rest of the figure." &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this recitation, the girl sat perfectly still. Then, with deliberation, she lit a cigarette. &nbsp; &#x201c;Notice the arc of the arm," Guido continued. The girl opened her perfect mouth. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Notice the feeblemindedness that passes for wit among aging graduate students," she said. Then she got up and left. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next time Guido saw her, she was getting on the bus. The weather had become savagely cold and she was struggling to get change out of her wallet but her gloves were getting in her way. Finally, she pulled off one of her gloves with her teeth. Guido watched, entranced. She wore a fur hat and two scarves. As she came down the aisle, Guido hid behind his book and stared at her all the way to Harvard Square, which was, it turned out, their common destination. They confronted each other at the newsstand. She looked him up and down and walked away. &nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two weeks later she turned up under more felicitous circumstances. She appeared at a tearoom with a girl named Paula Pierce-Williams, whom Guido had known all his life. Paula waved at him, and he ambled over to their table. &nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Guido, this is Holly Sturgis," said Paula. &#x201c;And Holly, this is Guido Morris." &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;We've met," said Holly Sturgis. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I never see you anymore, Guido," said Paula. &#x201c;Are you still working on your thesis?" &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I'm almost finished," said Guido. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I can never remember what it's on," said Paula. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Medieval property law and its relationship to courtly love," said Guido. Holly Sturgis snickered. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guido was not in the habit of falling in love with girls he saw on buses or in museums. He had had two serious love affairs and a small number of casual encounters. These he tried not to think about-they had puzzled and hurt him. He explained to himself that he was an old-fashioned man living in modern times, shackled with the belief that all real love affairs led to marriage. If they did not, they must in some way be bogus, built on bad faith or lack of true emotion. Therefore they were bad-once they were over, no matter how ardently one had begun them. The casual encounters Guido chalked up to sheer impulse. You could not call something that lasted for a day a love affair. Vincent tried to explain that these things were a matter of process-the process of growing up, but this was no consolation to Guido. In the case of his two serious love affairs, the partings had been equitable but not understandable: both the girls had married and sent him cards at Christmastime. Where, he wondered, had all that feeling gone?&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Now as he entered his thirties, he believed that one made mistakes in love until one was perfectly sure. That surety found its object in Holly Sturgis. He was serious in matters of the heart, and serious in matters of aesthetics. Something about Holly Sturgis struck him profoundly. One look announced her elegance and precision. Everything about her the calculation of her nloves, the grace with which she walked, the fact that she took off her gloves with her teeth-moved him. He believed that desire was mere shorthand for aesthetics and intuition. He wanted Holly Sturgis, plain and simple. He wanted access to that sleek, vital Japanese hair. He wanted her naked in his naked arms. He imagined that her shoulders smelled coolly of jasmine. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the way of people who fantasize rather than analyze, he knew that Holly was probably difficult, quirky, and hard to live with. It was obvious that she was precise-even her hair was precise. He knew all this because his daydreams were usually accurate-Vincent said he was a visual thinker. And so he imagined himself and Holly lying against crisp white sheets at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel. He did not bother to imagine how they got there or what led up to it. There would be anemones on the night table. Holly's hair would look like a sable paintbrush against the pillow and in his daydream she was smoking, balancing the ashtray on her stomach. The late afternoon light would be fuzzy with smoke. She would be entirely silent. He, of course, would be consumed by the event -it would be the first time they had been to bed together- and he saw himself looking cautiously at Holly, but unable to tell what that lovely, intelligent face was expressing or concealing from view. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paula Pierce-Williams poured the tea. Then she went off to make a telephone call. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Did you engineer this?" Holly said. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Certainly not," said Guido. &#x201c;I can't help it if you follow me around." &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I don't find that amusing. What do you want?" &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I want you to be more gracious to people who fall at your feet." &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I don't notice you falling at my feet." &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Maybe you don't know how to look," said Guido. He saw Paula walking toward them and quickly asked Holly to have dinner with him. To his astonishment, she said yes. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their first encounter did not take place at the Ritz-Carlton, but at Holly's. The anemones Guido had daydreamed about were a series of ferns that hung above her bed and got into his eyes when he sat up. The sheets were crisp, but not white. They were printed with violets. The pillowcases were decorated with blue roses. Holly was smoking and the ashtray balanced on her stomach was a little Wedgwood plate decorated with black vines. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holly's apartment was white and airy and it was as precise as Guido had imagined. Holly made small, absolute arrangements of things. On a white table was a bird's nest, an Egyptian figure in blue stone, a Russian match box, and a silver inkwell. The bed, before they had rumpled it, was made so that you could roll a dime across it. The sheets and pillows smelled of lavender. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was better than a daydream, better than those highly ornate night dreams that leave behind a sweet taste of inexplicable happiness in the morning. Guido turned to Holly and touched her dark, shining hair. She was wearing coral earrings the size of tuxedo studs and nothing else. It was a cold, rainy Saturday afternoon in late March, and Guido felt quite wiped out by sensation. Everything seemed uncommonly rich to him: the print on the sheets, the pattern on the quilt, Holly's gleaming hair and earrings. Her shoulders did smell of jasmine. When Guido turned to look at her, he saw on her face the look he had known he would see-a look so private and impenetrable and unclear that it rendered anything he thought of to say inappropriate. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holly was the granddaughter of old Walker Sturgis, who had taught classics. Her father was an executive in a copper company and her mother wrote historical novels for children. She was an only child, an only grandchild, and she was nearly perfect. She had her own ways, Holly did. She decanted everything into glass and on her long kitchen shelves were row upon row of jars containing soap, pencils, cookies, salt, tea, paper clips, and dried beans. She could tell if one of her arrangements was off by so much as a sixteenth of an inch and she corrected it. She was constantly fighting off the urge to straighten paintings in other people's houses. In her own house, her collection of botanical watercolors was absolutely straight. The shoes in her closet were stuffed with pink tissue paper and her drawers were filled with lavender sachet. In each corner of her closet hung a pomander ball. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She liked to have tea on a tray and she was fond of unmatched china. The tray she brought to Guido held cups that bore forget-me-nots, a lily-of-the-valley sugar dish, a cream pitcher with red poppies, and a teapot covered with red roses and cornflowers. This tray, when set on the bed, contributed to Guido's sensory overload. He was touched to think that this effort had been made on his behalf, but when he got to know Holly better he learned that she made up identical trays for herself when she studied. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guido had wondered if she knew how to cook. Her slight air of otherworldliness suggested that she did not, while her precision indicated that she did-in the way the Japanese did. He expected a dinner that looked like a painting. It turned out that she was a real marvel. Guido was surprised by the sheer deliciousness of it: food that good must, he felt, spring from a truly charitable, loving spirit. But charity did not seem to be in Holly's immediate emotional vocabulary. After a spectacular afternoon in bed, they had spent the rest of the day in polite half silence. Therefore, dinner almost did him in. Not only did it taste wonderful, it looked wonderful. Guido pegged Holly as a strong domestic sensualist. She had a positive genius for comfort but he was only a visitor: that comfort had been created long before he met her. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He spent a sleepless night next to her, very much aware, even when he dozed, that he was sleeping in a stranger's bed. &nbsp; He dreamed brief, disconnected dreams and woke suddenly, unsure of where he was. The sight of Holly did not immediately locate him-she seemed so dreamlike and unapproachable. He spent a long time gazing at her and realized that he did not want to go to sleep. He did not want to miss a minute of her. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he did sleep, and when he woke...</p><h2>Glencoe Science: Biology, Teacher Edition</h2><p>GLENCOE Science BIOLOGY hard cover TEACHER&#39;S EDITION.</p><p></p><h2>A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms</h2><p>A century before A GAME OF THRONES, two unlikely heroes wandered WesterosA KNIGHT OF THE SEVEN KINGDOMS compiles the first three official prequel novellas to George R.R.

But with so much variety between an Alfred Hitchcock thriller and a Nora Ephron romantic comedy, how can everyday viewers determine what makes a good movie? <br><br>In <i>Talking Pictures</i>, veteran film critic Ann Hornaday walks us through the production of a typical movie--from script and casting to final sound edit--and explains how to evaluate each piece of the process. How do we know if a film has been well-written, above and beyond snappy dialogue? What constitutes a great screen performance? What goes into praiseworthy cinematography, editing, and sound design? And what does a director really do? In a new epilogue, Hornaday addresses important questions of representation in film and the industry and how this can, and should, effect a movie-watching experience. Full of engaging anecdotes and interviews with actors and filmmakers, <i>Talking Pictures</i> will help us see movies in a whole new light-not just as fans, but as film critics in our own right. <br><br></p><p>Ann Hornaday is a film critic at the <i>Washington Post </i>and was a finalist for the 2008 Pulitzer Prize in criticism.

Sometimes when you wake up at night, you wonder if you&#x2019;ve put your faith in the right people.

It drives you to <i>do</i> something, to act&#x2014;only when you&#x2019;re stuck on an island in the middle of Lake Michigan, you&#x2019;re kind of limited in your choices of exactly what you can do to blow off steam.</p><p>I&#x2019;d gone with my usual option. I was running through long tunnels filled with demons and monsters and nightmares, because it was easier than going to the gym.</p><p>The tunnels were big, the size of some of the substreets beneath the city of Chicago, their walls made of earth and stone, wound through with things that looked like roots but could not possibly belong to any tree this deep in the earth. Every few yards, more or less at random, there was a mound of luminous pale green quartz crystals. Inside every crystal mound was a recumbent, shadowy form. Some of the mounds held figures no larger than a medium-sized dog. Some of them were the size of houses.</p><p>I had just finished climbing over one of the huge mounds and was sprinting toward the next, the first in a series of three mounds more or less the size of my deceased Volkswagen.</p><p>&#x201c;Parkour!&#x201d; I shouted, and leapt, hitting the top of the mound with my hands and vaulting over it. I landed on the far side, dropped into a forward roll over one shoulder, and came up running.</p><p>&#x201c;Parkour!&#x201d; I shouted at the next mound, putting one hand down as I leapt, using it to guide my body up to the horizontal at the same level as my head, clearing the next mound, landing, and staying on the move.</p><p>&#x201c;Parkour!&#x201d; I screamed again at the third, and simply dove over it in a long arc. The idea was to clear it, land on my hands, drop into a smooth roll, and come up running again, but it didn&#x2019;t work out that way. I misjudged the dive, my foot caught a crystal, and I belly flopped and planted my face in the dirt on the far side of the mound.</p><p>I lay there on the ground for a moment, getting back the wind I&#x2019;d knocked out of myself. Taking a fall wasn&#x2019;t a big deal. God knows, I&#x2019;ve done it enough. I rolled over onto my back and groaned. &#x201c;Harry, you&#x2019;ve got way too much time on your hands.&#x201d;</p><p>My voice echoed through the tunnel, number seven of thirteen.</p><p>&#x201c;Parkour,&#x201d; said a distant echo.</p><p>I shook my head, pushed myself up, and started walking out. Walking through one of the tunnels beneath the island of Demonreach was always an experience. When I ran, I went by the mounds pretty quick.</p><p>When I walked, the prisoners trapped inside them had time to talk to me.</p><p><i>Let me fulfill your every desire</i>, crooned a silken voice in my head as I went by one.</p><p><i>Blood and power, riches and strength, I can give you all that you&#x2014;</i>promised the next.</p><p><i>One day, mortal, I will be free and suck the marrow from your bones,</i> snarled another.</p><p><i>Bow down in fear and horror before me!</i></p><p><i>Loathe me, let me devour you, and I will make real your dreams.</i></p><p><i>Release me or I will destroy you!</i></p><p><i>Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Sleep and let me inside you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i></p><p><i>Bloodpaindeathbloodfleshbloodpaindeath&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i></p><p><i>BLARGLE SLORG NOTH HARGHLE FTHAGN!</i></p><p>You know.</p><p>The usual.</p><p>I skirted around a fairly small mound whose occupant had simply sent me a mental picture that had kept me up for a couple of nights the last time I walked by, and passed one of the last mounds before the exit.</p><p>As I walked by, the mound&#x2019;s occupant projected a mental sigh and an unmistakable image of a man rolling his eyes. <i>Ah. A new one.</i></p><p>I paused and studied the mound. As a rule, I didn&#x2019;t communicate with the prisoners. If you were locked up under Demonreach, you were a nightmare the likes of which few people could really understand&#x2014;immortal, savage, and probably foaming-at-the-mouth, hair-on-fire crazy to boot.</p><p>But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&#x2019;d been locked up almost as well as the prisoners for months, trapped on the island and in the caverns beneath. There wasn&#x2019;t a lot of choice. Until I got the thing in my head out again, only the island had the power to keep it in check. I had visitors sometimes, but the winter months were dangerous on Lake Michigan, both because of the weather and because of the ice, and spring had only barely begun to touch the world again. It had been a while since I&#x2019;d seen anyone.</p><p>So I eyed the mound, one about the size of a coffin, and said, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your problem?&#x201d;</p><p><i>You, obviously,</i> replied the occupant. <i>Do you even know what the word </i>stasis<i> means? It means nothing is happening. You standing here, walking by, talking to me, for God&#x2019;s sake, buggers that up entirely, the way you novices always do. What was the phrase? Ah, yes. Piss off.</i></p><p>I lifted my eyebrows. To date, every single prisoner who had tried to communicate with me had been pretty obviously playing to get out, or else howling nuts. This guy just sounded&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. British.</p><p>&#x201c;Huh,&#x201d; I said.</p><p><i>Did you hear me, Warden? Piss. Off.</i></p><p>I debated taking him literally, just to be a wiseass, but decided that body humor was beneath the dignity of a Wizard of the White Council and the Warden of Demonreach, thus disproving everyone who says I am nothing but an overgrown juvenile delinquent.</p><p>&#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d; I asked instead.</p><p>There was a long moment of silence. And then a thought filled with a terrible weariness and purely emotional anguish, like something I&#x2019;d experienced only at the very lowest moments of my life, flowed into me&#x2014;but for this being, such pain wasn&#x2019;t a low point. It was a constant state. <i>Someone who needs to be here. Go away, boy.</i></p><p>A rolling wave of nausea went through me. The air was suddenly too bright, the gentle glow of the crystals too piercing. I found myself taking several steps back from the mound, until that awful tide of feeling had receded, but the headache those emotions had triggered found me nonetheless, and I was abruptly in too much pain to keep my feet.</p><p>I dropped to one knee, clenching my teeth on a scream. The headaches had gotten steadily worse, and despite a lifetime of learning to cope with pain, despite the power of the mantle of the Winter Knight, they had begun kicking my ass thoroughly a few weeks before.</p><p>For a while, there was simply pain, and aching, racking nausea.</p><p>Eventually, that began to grow slowly less, and I looked up to see a hulking form in a dark cloak standing over me. It was ten or twelve feet tall, and built on the same scale as a massively muscled human, though I never really seemed to see much of the being beneath the cloak. It stared down at me, a pair of pinpoints of green, fiery light serving as eyes within the depths of its hood.</p><p>&#x201c;WARDEN,&#x201d; it said, its voice a deep rumble, &#x201c;I HAVE SUPPRESSED THE PARASITE FOR NOW.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2019;Bout time, Alfred,&#x201d; I muttered. I sat up and took stock of myself. I&#x2019;d been lying there for a while. The sweat on my skin had dried. That was bad. The ancient spirit of the island had been keeping the thing in my skull from killing me for a year. Until a few weeks ago, when my head started hurting, all it had to do was show up, speak a word, and the pain would go away.</p><p>This time it had taken more than an hour.</p><p>Whatever was in my head, some kind of psychic or spiritual creature that was using me to grow, was getting ready to kill me.</p><p>&#x201c;ALFRED,&#x201d; the spirit said soberly. &#x201c;IS THIS TO BE MY NEW NAME?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s stick with Demonreach,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>The enormous spirit considered that. &#x201c;I AM THE ISLAND.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, yes,&#x201d; I said, gathering myself to my feet. &#x201c;Its spirit. Its genius loci.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;AND I AM ALSO SEPARATE FROM THE ISLAND. A VESSEL.&#x201d;</p><p>I eyed the spirit. &#x201c;You know the name &#x2018;Alfred&#x2019; is a joke, right?&#x201d;</p><p>It stared at me. A wind that didn&#x2019;t exist stirred the hem of its cloak.</p><p>I raised my hands in surrender and said, &#x201c;All right. I guess you need a first name, too. Alfred Demonreach it is.&#x201d;</p><p>Its eyes flickered brighter for a moment and it inclined its head to me within the hood. Then it said, &#x201c;SHE IS HERE.&#x201d;</p><p>I jerked my head up, my heart suddenly speeding. It made little echoes of pain go through my head. Had she finally responded to my messages? &#x201c;Molly?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;NOT GRASSHOPPER. GRASSHOPPER&#x2019;S NEW MOTHER.&#x201d;</p><p>I felt tension slide into my shoulders and neck. &#x201c;Mab,&#x201d; I said in a low, hard voice.</p><p>&#x201c;YES.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fantastic,&#x201d; I muttered. Mab, the Queen of Air and Darkness, Monarch of the Winter Court of the Sidhe, mistress and mentor of every wicked being in Faerie&#x2014;my boss&#x2014;had been ignoring me for months. I&#x2019;d been sending her messengers on an increasingly regular basis to no avail. At least, not until today.</p><p>But why now? Why show up now, after all those months of silence?</p><p>&#x201c;Because, dummy,&#x201d; I muttered to myself, &#x201c;she wants something.&#x201d; I turned to Demonreach. &#x201c;Okay, Alfred. Where?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;DOCK.&#x201d;</p><p>Which was smart. Demonreach, like practically every prison ever, was just as well suited to keeping visitors out as it was to keeping them in. When a freaking Walker of the Outside and his posse had shown up to perform a massive jailbreak on the island&#x2019;s prisoners, they had been beaten back, thanks to the efforts of the island&#x2019;s defenses and several key allies.</p><p>I&#x2019;d spent the last year acquainting myself with the island&#x2019;s secrets, with the defenses that I hadn&#x2019;t even known existed&#x2014;defenses that could be activated only by the Warden. If the Walker tried that play again, I could shut him down single-handed. Even Mab, as powerful as she was, would be well-advised to be cautious if she decided to start trouble on Demonreach&#x2019;s soil.</p><p>Which was why she was standing on the dock.</p><p>She expected me to be upset. Definitely, she wanted something.</p><p>In my experience, when the Queen of Air and Darkness decides she wants something from you, it&#x2019;s a good time to crawl in a hole and pull it in after you.</p><p>But my head pulsed with little twinges of pain. My headaches had slowly gotten worse and worse over several years, and I had only recently discovered their cause&#x2014;I had a condition that had to be taken care of before whatever was hanging out in my noggin decided to burst its way out of my skull. I didn&#x2019;t dare leave the island until that happened, and if Mab had finally decided to respond to my messages, I had little choice but to meet with her.</p><p>Which was probably why she <i>hadn&#x2019;t</i> shown up to talk to me&#x2014;until now.</p><p>&#x201c;Freaking manipulative faeries,&#x201d; I muttered under my breath. Then I headed for the stairs leading out of the Well and up to the island&#x2019;s surface. &#x201c;Stay nearby and pay attention,&#x201d; I told Demonreach.</p><p>&#x201c;DO YOU SUSPECT SHE MEANS YOU HARM?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Heh,&#x201d; I said, starting up the stairs. &#x201c;One way or another. Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>Two</p><p>My brother and I had built the Whatsup Dock down at the shore at one of Demonreach&#x2019;s three little beaches, the one nearest the opening in the stone reefs surrounding the island. There had been a town on the hillside up above the beach maybe a century before, but it had been abandoned after its residents had apparently been driven slowly bonkers by all the dark energy around the hideous things imprisoned below the island.</p><p>The ruins of the town were still there, half swallowed by the forest, a corpse being slowly devoured by fungus and moss. I sometimes wondered how long I could stay on the damned island before I was bonkers, too.</p><p>There was an expensive motored yacht tied to the dock, as out of place as a Ferrari in a cattle yard, white with a lot of frosty blue chrome. There were a couple of hands in sight, and they weren&#x2019;t dressed in sailing clothes so much as they were in sailing costumes. The creases were too straight, the clothes too clean, the fit too perfect. Watching them move, I had no doubt they were carrying weapons, and practiced in killing. They were Sidhe, the lords of Faerie, tall and beautiful and dangerous. They didn&#x2019;t impress me.</p><p>Mostly because they weren&#x2019;t nearly as pretty or dangerous as the woman standing at the very end of my dock, the tips of her expensive shoes half an inch from Demonreach&#x2019;s shore. When there&#x2019;s a Great White Shark in the water with you, it&#x2019;s tough to be worried about a couple of barracuda swimming along behind her.</p><p>Mab, the Queen of Air and Darkness, was wearing a tailored business suit somewhere between the color of smeared charcoal on newsprint and frozen periwinkles. The blouse beneath was snow-white, like her hair, which was bound up in an elaborate do that belonged in the forties. Opals flashed on her ears and at her throat, deep colors of green and blue, matching the shifting hues of her cold, flat eyes. She was pale, beautiful on a scale that beggared simple description, and I harbored a healthy and rational terror of her.</p><p>I came down the old stone steps in the hillside to the dock, and stopped an arm&#x2019;s length away from Mab. I didn&#x2019;t bow to her, but I inclined my head formally. There were other Sidhe there, on the boat, witnessing the meeting, and I had worked out a while ago that though I was no danger to Mab&#x2019;s pride, she would not tolerate disrespect to her office. I was pretty sure that if the Winter Knight openly defied her in front of her Court, it would basically be a declaration of war, and despite what I now knew about the island, I wanted nothing of the sort with Mab.</p><p>&#x201c;My Queen,&#x201d; I said pleasantly. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s tricks?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Functioning flawlessly, my Knight,&#x201d; she replied. &#x201c;As ever. Get on the boat.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>Her mouth turned down into a slight frown, but it was belied by the sudden pleased light in her eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m predictable, aren&#x2019;t I?&#x201d; I asked her.</p><p>&#x201c;In many ways,&#x201d; she replied. &#x201c;Shall I answer you literally?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d like that.&#x201d;</p><p>Mab nodded. Then she leaned forward, very slightly, her eyes growing deep, and said in a voice colder and harder than frozen stone, &#x201c;Because I told you to do so.&#x201d;</p><p>I swallowed, and my stomach did this little roller-coaster number on me. &#x201c;What happens if I won&#x2019;t?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;You have already made clear to me that you will resist me if I attempt to compel you directly to obey my commands,&#x201d; Mab said. &#x201c;Such a thing would render you useless to me, and for the moment, I would find it inconvenient to train a replacement. I would therefore do nothing.&#x201d;</p><p>I blinked at that. &#x201c;Nothing? I could deny you, and you&#x2019;d just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. go?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Indeed,&#x201d; Mab said, turning. &#x201c;You will be dead in three days, by which time I should have made arrangements to replace you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Uh,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>Mab paused and looked over her shoulder. &#x201c;The parasite within y...</p></p><h2>Distant Water: The Fate of the North Atlantic Fisherman</h2><p>Chronicles the history of the North Atlantic Fishing Fleet since World War II, narrates the day-to-day occupations of shipboard life, and examines the fleet&#39;s current operations and future prospects</p><p></p><h2>The Lazlo Letters</h2><p>In letters to stars, dignitaries, and chairmen of the country's most powerful organizations, Don Novello's alter ego Lazlo Toth pestered his victims for photographs, offered outlandish advice, fired off strange inquiries, and more.

She also remained one of the most private of all the public figures of her time.<br>In 1983 - at the age of seventy-five, her career cresting - the four-time Academy Award winner opened her door to biographer A. Scott Berg - then thirty-three - and began a special friendship, one that endured to the end of her illustrious life.<br>From the start, Scott Berg felt that Katharine Hepburn intended his role to be not just that of a friend but also of a chronicler, a confidant who might record for posterity her thoughts and feelings. Over the next twenty years, Kate used their many hours together to reveal all that came to mind, often reflecting on the people and episodes of her past, occasionally on the meaning of life.<br>Here are the stories from those countless intimate conversations, and much more. In addition to recording heretofore untold biographical details of her entire phenomenal career and her famous relationships with such men as Spencer Tracy and Howard Hughes, Kate Remembered also tells the amusing, often emotional story of one of the most touching friendships in her final years. Scott Berg provides his own memories of Katharine Hepburn offstage - quiet dinners in her town house in New York City, winter swims (she swam, he watched) in the Long Island Sound at Fenwick, her home in Connecticut, weekend visits with family members and dear friends ... even some unusual appearances by the likes of Michael Jackson and Warren Beatty. Finally, Kate Remembered discusses the legendary actress's moving farewell, during which her mighty personality surrendered at last to her failing body - all the while remaining true to her courageous character.</p><p>Published a mere 13 days after the death of Katharine Hepburn, <i>Kate Remembered</i> is best appreciated as a valentine of devoted friendship. It's a moving study of mutual trust and admiration between Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer A. Scott Berg and legendary Hollywood icon Hepburn, who'd established an instant rapport in 1983, beginning a 20-year conversation that blossomed into this enchanting "biographical memoir." As a casual but authoritative survey of Hepburn's career, Berg's book offers little new information to anyone who's read previous Hepburn biographies or <i>Me: Stories of My Life</i>, Hepburn's bestselling 1991 memoir. But the duality of Berg's title reinforces his purpose: "More than my remembrances," writes Berg in his author's note, "this book intends to convey hers." As such, <i>Kate Remembered</i> offers a rare, unvarnished portrait of one of the 20th century's most influential women, achieving a personal intimacy while making the reader feel welcomed in Hepburn's private world of privilege. <p> </p><p> Although Berg (the acclaimed biographer of legendary editor Max Perkins, producer/mogul Samuel Goldwyn, and aviator Charles Lindbergh) had written all but the final paragraphs by 2001, Hepburn insisted this book remain unpublished until after her death, which came, in quiet dignity at age 96, on June 29, 2003. Given the book's pre-publication secrecy, it's hardly tabloid-worthy, serving instead to correct or clarify details from Hepburn's glory days--especially her long-term affair with Spencer Tracy--while offering choice bits of Hollywood gossip, Hepburn's frequently scathing assessments of other actors, and amusing encounters with such luminaries as Michael Jackson and Warren Beatty (both of whom appear as mock suitors with selfish motivations). It's a brisk read but a substantial one, richly emotional and as dignified as Hepburn herself, whose faults and foibles make her even more appealing than her beloved public persona. <i>--Jeff Shannon</i></p>A.

His father, who had been disappointed in him, had left him only enough money to open a modest booth in the Bazaar. When he was not selling carpets, Abdullah spent his time daydreaming. In his dreams he was not the son of his father, but the long-lost son of a prince. There was also a princess who had been betrothed to him at birth. He was content with his life and his daydreams until, one day, a stranger sold him a magic carpet.</p><p>In this stunning sequel to <i>Howl's Moving Castle,</i> Diana Wynne Jones has again created a large-scale, fast-paced fantasy in which people and things are never quite what they seem. There are good and bad djinns, a genie in a bottle, wizards, witches, cats and dogs (but are they cats and dogs?), and a mysterious floating castle filled with kidnapped princesses, as well as two puzzling prophecies. The story speeds along with tantalizing twists and turns until the prophecies are fulfilled, true identities are revealed, and all is resolved in a totally satisfying, breathtaking, surprise-filled ending.</p></p><p>In which a humble youg carpet merchant wins, then loses, the princess of his dreams<p>Far to the south of the land of Ingary, in the Sultanates of Rashpuht, there lived in the city of Zanzib a young and not very prosperous carpet dealer named Abdullah who loved to spend his time daydreaming. He was content with his life and his daydreams until, one day, a stranger sold him a magic carpet.</p><p>That very night, the carpet flew him to an enchanted garden. There, he met and fell in love with the beauteous princess Flower-in-the-Night, only to have her snatched away, right under his very nose, by a wicked djinn. With only his magic carpet and his wits to help him, Abdullah sets off to rescue his princess. . . .</p><p>Diana Wynne Jones was raised in the village of Thaxted, in Essex, England. She has been a compulsive storyteller for as long as she can remember enjoying most ardently those tales dealing with witches, hobgoblins, and the like. Ms. Jones lives in Bristol, England, with her husband, a professor of English at Bristol University. They have three sons and two granddaughters.</p><p>In Her Own Words...</p><p>"I decided to be a writer at the age of eight, but I did not receive any encouragement in this ambition until thirty years later. I think this ambition was fired-or perhaps exacerbated is a better word-by early marginal contacts with the Great, when we were evacuated to the English Lakes during the war. The house we were in had belonged to Ruskin's secretary and had also been the home of the children in the books of Arthur Ransome. One day, finding I had no paper to draw on, I stole from the attic a stack of exquisite flower-drawings, almost certainly by Ruskin himself, and proceeded to rub them out. I was punished for this. Soon after, we children offended Arthur Ransome by making a noise on the shore beside his houseboat. He complained. So likewise did Beatrix Potter, who lived nearby. It struck me then that the Great were remarkably touchy and unpleasant (even if, in Ruskin's case, it was posthumous), and I thought I would like to be the same, without the unpleasantness.</p><p>"I started writing children's books when we moved to a village in Essex where there were almost no books. The main activities there were hand-weaving, hand-making pottery, and singing madrigals, for none of which I had either taste or talent. So, in intervals between trying to haunt the church and sitting on roofs hoping to learn to fly, I wrote enormous epic adventure stories which I read to my sisters instead of the real books we did not have. This writing was stopped, though, when it was decided I must be coached to go to University. A local philosopher was engaged to teach me Greek and philosophy in exchange for a dollhouse (my family never did things normally), and I eventually got a place at Oxford.</p><p>"At this stage, despite attending lectures by J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis, I did not expect to be writing fantasy. But that was what I started to write when I was married and had children of my own. It was what they liked best. But small children do not allow you the use of your brain. They used to jump on my feet to stop me thinking. And I had not realized how much I needed to teach myself about writing. I took years to learn, and it was not until my youngest child began school that I was able to produce a book which a publisher did not send straight back.</p><p>"As soon as my books began to be published, they started coming true. Fantastic things that I thought I had made up keep happening to me. The most spectacular was<i> Drowned Ammet</i>. The first time I went on a boat after writing that book, an island grew up out of the sea and stranded us. This sort of thing, combined with the fact that I have a travel jinx, means that my life is never dull."</p><p>Diana Wynne Jones is the author of many highly praised books for young readers, as well as three plays for children and a novel for adults. She lives in Bristol, England, with her husband, a professor of English at Bristol University. They have three sons.</p></p><h2>Indignation</h2><p>Against the backdrop of the Korean War, a young man faces life&#x2019;s unimagined chances and terrifying consequences.<br><br>It is 1951 in America, the second year of the Korean War. A studious, law-abiding, intense youngster from Newark, New Jersey, Marcus Messner, is beginning his sophomore year on the pastoral, conservative campus of Ohio&#x2019;s Winesburg College. And why is he there and not at the local college in Newark where he originally enrolled? Because his father, the sturdy, hard-working neighborhood butcher, seems to have gone mad -- mad with fear and apprehension of the dangers of adult life, the dangers of the world, the dangers he sees in every corner for his beloved boy.<br><br>As the long-suffering, desperately harassed mother tells her son, the father&#x2019;s fear arises from love and pride. Perhaps, but it produces too much anger in Marcus for him to endure living with his parents any longer. He leaves them and, far from Newark, in the midwestern college, has to find his way amid the customs and constrictions of another American world.<br><br>Indignation, Philip Roth&#x2019;s twenty-ninth book, is a story of inexperience, foolishness, intellectual resistance, sexual discovery, courage, and error. It is a story told with all the inventive energy and wit Roth has at his command, at once a startling departure from the haunted narratives of old age and experience in his recent books and a powerful addition to his investigations of the impact of American history on the life of the vulnerable individual.</p><p><b>Amazon Best of the Month, September 2008</b>: Enter once again into the echo chamber of Philip Roth's memory and imagination. In the second year of the Korean War, a butcher's son--a straight-A student wound tight with aspiration--flees Newark and his father's increasingly unhinged fears for his safety. Heading midwest, he finds a strange collegiate land of fraternities, football heroes, V-neck pullover sweaters and white buckskin shoes, panty raids, and mandatory chapel services, and, most startlingly, a young woman with desires of her own. Like another fiction grandmaster of his generation, Alice Munro, Roth seems able to spin infinite surprising tales from a few familiar building blocks, and in <i>Indignation</i>, his 25th novel, he has constructed a taut, haunting (and, as always, funny) story that ranks among his best. Reading at times like a buttoned-down <i>Portnoy's Complaint</i> (if it's possible to imagine such a thing), <i>Indignation</i> records a series of small explosions against '50s propriety and the dire consequences they lead to, capturing the misery of desire amid repression, along with the greater terror of being trapped in endless, relentless memory. <i>--Tom Nissley</i>"<i>Indignation</i> is impossible to put down until it's finished.

This collection of over 100 unpublished letters from the bestselling author of such spiritual classics as <i>The Return of the Prodigal Son</i> and <i>The Wounded Healer</i> offers deep spiritual insight into human experience, intimacy, brokeness, and mercy</b>.<br><br>Over the course of his life, Henri Nouwen wrote thousands of letters to friends, acquaintances, parishioners, students, and readers of his work all around the world. He corresponded in English, Dutch, German, French, and Spanish, and took great care to store and archive the letters decade after decade. He believed that a thoughtful letter written in love could truly change someone's life. Many people looked to Nouwen as a long distance spiritual advisor.&nbsp;<br><br><i>Love, Henri</i> consists of over a hundred letters that stretch from the earliest years of Henri's career up through his last 10 years at L'Arche Daybreak. Rich in spiritual insights the letters highlight a number themes that emerged in both Henri's work over the years, including vocation, solitude, prayer, suffering, and perseverance in difficult times. These deeply spiritual letters, sometimes poignant, sometimes funny, ulimately demonstrate the rich value of communicating with God through others.</p><p>HENRI NOUWEN was a Dutch-born Catholic priest, professor, and pastor, who gained international renown as the author of over 30 books on the spiritual life, including such classics as <i>The Wounded Healer</i>, <i>The Inner Voice of Love</i>, and <i>The Return of the Prodigal Son</i>. Nouwen's books have been translated into more than 30 languages and have sold upwards of seven million copies worldwide, resonating with people across the religious, spiritual, cultural, and political spectrum. Since his death in 1996, ever-increasing numbers of readers, writers, teachers, and seekers have been guided by his literary legacy.<p>Part I</p><p>December 1973&#x2013;1985</p><p>The letters begin in late 1973, just weeks before Henri&#x2019;s forty-second birthday. By that time Henri had been a priest for sixteen years. He was teaching at Yale Divinity School, and beginning to emerge as a widely read writer on spirituality. The chapter concludes more than a decade later, in 1985, when--now at Harvard Divinity School--he experienced his first stirrings of attraction to L&#x2019;Arche and the path he would follow for the rest of his life.</p><p>Henri&#x2019;s early life had been one of privilege and opportunity. He had grown up in the Netherlands within a loving and cultured family, traveled extensively, and circulated easily within Holland&#x2019;s important social and intellectual circles. After his ordination in 1957, he was sent to the University of Nijmegen to study psychology. This was followed by a two-year graduate training program in theology and psychiatric theory at the Menninger Foundation in Topeka, Kansas, where he distinguished himself among the leading minds in the emerging disciplines of pastoral psychology and clinical pastoral education.</p><p>The time spent at the Menninger Foundation was Henri&#x2019;s first extensive stay in the United States and, as he describes it, the place where he grew up:</p><p>It was here that my life came into focus. For the first time I was dealt with as someone who also had something to say. For the first time I had to think for myself, and people took what I said critically. There I came in touch with myself as a separate human being.*</p><p>He also became aware of wider political events. He learned of the civil rights movement and the work of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. He participated in the march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, in 1965 and was introduced to the voices of conscientious objectors to the Vietnam War and anti&#x2013;nuclear war protestors in the US peace movement.</p><p>His emerging confidence and bold integration of psychology with pastoral care began to draw attention. After completing the certificate program in 1966, he was offered a teaching position in the newly established psychology department at the University of Notre Dame, Indiana. He accepted, and for two years taught courses there including &#x201c;Psychology of Religion,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Psychology of Personality,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Abnormal Psychology.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>Henri&#x2019;s ambitions, however, didn&#x2019;t lie in the United States. He assumed that he would return to Holland and find his place in Dutch society. He left Notre Dame in 1968, returned home and taught first at the Amsterdam Joint Pastoral Institute and then at the Catholic Theological Institute in Utrecht, two new Catholic schools set up to integrate psychology into pastoral education.</p><p>Henri became popular with the students, but his &#x201c;American&#x201d; teaching style and focus on the methodologies he had learned at the Menninger Foundation put him into conflict with colleagues.* It was the first indication that his home was not in fact, to be in Holland.* He decided to earn a doctorate in theology at the University of Nijmegen, hoping it might add to his credibility, but the tensions only increased.</p><p>For his thesis, Henri expanded on research from his time at Menninger. However, his dissertation was found insufficiently theological and he was told to rework it. He tried to submit it for a doctorate in psychology instead, but in that department it was deemed not empirical enough. He became frustrated and restless. An associate from that time describes him as &#x201c;running out of patience&#x201d; and feeling like &#x201c;all was going on in a slow way.&#x201d;*&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, American interest in Henri&#x2019;s academic approach was growing. In 1969, he had published his first book, Intimacy: Pastoral Psychological Essays (Notre Dame, IN: Fides, 1969), based on a series of lectures he gave at Notre Dame on pastoral care. In it, Henri explored a question that would become central to his life: &#x201c;How can I find a creative and fulfilling intimacy with God and my fellow human beings?&#x201d; The book resonated with American readers, who saw his question as their own.&nbsp;</p><p>As Henri considered his options for the doctorate, he received an invitation from Yale Divinity School in New Haven, Connecticut, to teach pastoral theology. Impatient with the Dutch academic system, he accepted and by August 1971 was on his way back to the United States. He would never live in Holland again.</p><p>When Henri arrived at the Protestant, nondenominational Yale, he was one of only two Catholics on the faculty. But he quickly became a popular lecturer, teaching a range of courses on the spiritual life including &#x201c;Christian Spirituality,&#x201d; &#x201c;Pastoral Care and Counseling,&#x201d; &#x201c;Prison Ministry,&#x201d; &#x201c;Ministry to the Elderly&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Life and Works of Thomas Merton.&#x201d; His writing continued apace. By 1974, he had published three more books, including his best seller The Wounded Healer: Ministry in Contemporary Society (Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1972).</p><p>He enjoyed the vibrant community life at Yale but soon became restless about his vocational path. He was drawn to the contemplative tradition of the fourth-century Desert Mothers and Fathers and was inspired by the monk and writer Thomas Merton. Over the next few years he made two extended stays in a Trappist monastery in upstate New York to explore that calling.&nbsp;</p><p>He also considered a life of action in service to the poor. At the time, Latin America was exploding in violence. Henri was drawn to the plight of the people there and made regular visits to the region. In 1981, after ten good years at Yale, he left his tenured position to become a missionary with the Maryknoll Fathers in a barrio in Lima, Peru.</p><p>But neither missionary work nor the life of contemplation proved a good fit. Though he didn&#x2019;t have the temperament for missionary work, he was an impassioned speaker about the spirituality of peacemaking, and in 1983 he went on a ten-week tour of the United States to speak about the injustice he had witnessed in Nicaragua. And though he didn&#x2019;t have the aptitude for the cloistered life, his book The Genesee Diary: Report from a Trappist Monastery (Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1976) was enthusiastically received by many wanting to learn about life in a contemporary monastery.</p><p>What was beginning to emerge was that, at his core, Henri was a pastor. Wherever he went, people were drawn to his gifts for ministry and counseling. He began to receive more and more letters asking for help. They came from students, some long graduated, in times of vocational discernment or life-crisis. They came from ministers who had heard him speak and needed support and encouragement. Hundreds of requests for advice came from his rapidly growing reading audience.</p><p>In 1983, after being courted by the Harvard Divinity School to rejoin academia, Henri decided to continue with his teaching career on a part-time basis. He would teach one semester a year and continue his work in Latin America for the remaining months. However, Harvard was another bad fit. His personal, pastoral style ran up against the competitive culture of the Divinity School. He wrote of the time: &#x201c;I had a feeling that Harvard was not where God wanted me to be. It&#x2019;s too much podium, too much publicity, too public. Too many people came to listen. . . . It&#x2019;s not an intimate place. It&#x2019;s a place of intellectual battle.&#x201d;* He became increasingly lonely and depressed.</p><p>In this time of doubt, Henri received an invitation from Jean Vanier, a Canadian who in 1964 had started a community for people with physical and mental disabilities. Vanier invited Henri to visit L&#x2019;Arche in Trosly-Breuil, a small village north of Paris. Henri visited L&#x2019;Arche several times between 1982 and 1985, staying for longer intervals each time.</p><p>Vanier saw Henri as a deeply spiritual man with many gifts, but also one who needed a home. L&#x2019;Arche became that home. In July 1985, Henri resigned from Harvard and took up a one-year residency at L&#x2019;Arche � Trosly beginning in August. He had finally found his vocational path.</p><p>* From unpublished interview with Gene Knudsen Hoffman, &#x201c;Concertmaster of Souls,&#x201d; The Compassionate Listening Project, 1982, 5, in Gene K.

Can it be true that I don&#39;t love Jesus as much as I used to?&#39; &#39;Is that all, dear? I think you are being a bit silly.&#39; After she had gone, Horace thought about the strange incident. &#39;I wonder if I will ever understand her. How often I seem to hurt her when I mean only to please.&#39; In this sequel to Elsie&#39;s Endless Wait, readers will travel once more to the pre-Civil War world of Elsie Dinsmore, the young heiress deprived of a parent&#39;s love until she was almost nine years old. Elsie and her father seem to have reconciled, but can Horace Dinsmore ever accept his daughter&#39;s Christian faith? Or will his pride lead to tragic consequences? What is the terrible decision Elsie must make? Elsie&#39;s Impossible Choice is the second book in the Elsie Dinsmore: A Life of Faith series. These intriguing stories of a young girl&#39;s faith, purity of heart, and simple Christian devotion became an American classic over a hundred years ago. Based on and adapted from the original 1869 novels by Martha Finley, Elsie&#39;s Impossible Choice continues the exciting and inspiring story that has captivated generations of readers.</p><p>For girls ages 10-14 ? About 100 years ago, a bright-eyed little girl named Elsie Dinsmore stole the hearts of parents and children around the world. In 28 novels published between 1868 and 1904, Elsie exemplified true biblical faith in the face of adversity--inspiring generations of girls and young women. Now Elsie&#39;s story comes to life again in a completely updated series adapted from the original novels. While faithful to Martha Finley&#39;s stories and characters, these adaptations also meet the needs and interests of contemporary young readers. We first meet Elsie when she is eight years old and living on her grandfather&#39;s plantation in the South. In succeeding novels, she grows up, finds love, marries and has her own children, and eventually becomes a grandmother. Throughout her life, Elsie faces each new challenge--from personal temptations to the tragedies of war and the loss of loved ones--with strength, courage, and trust in the love and guidance of her Heavenly Father. Zondervan is pleased to offer the first four volumes of this timeless series. Although set in a distant time and place, they are as lively, engaging, and relevant as the best of modern Christian juvenile fiction. The Elsie Dinsmore series promises to provide inspiration and encouragement to a new generation of girls.Mission City Press is a Christian publishing company dedicated to teaching kids to live a life of faith with passionate devotion to Jesus Christ.</p><h2>Dusk and Other Stories</h2><p>Offers a collection of stories that expose the surface beauty of relationships and places, as well as their underlying flaws, reflecting the moments, experiences, and details that shape lives</p><p>This short-story collection won the 1989 PEN/Faulkner Award for James Salter, author of Solo Faces and A Sport and A Pastime. Here, Salter&#39;s themes are memory and loss, the demands of honor and the inherent betrayals of sexual relations. Salter works like a miniaturist, evoking vast landscapes in a few lines: &#34;Nothing is safe except for an hour,&#34; he writes in one beautiful story, opening up a whole world-view. Often, at the end of a story that runs only a few pages, the perspective suddenly broadens, the prose elevates to an abstract lyricism, and the reader is transported.<b>&nbsp;James Salter</b> is the author of the novels<i> Light Years, A Sport and a Pastime, Solo Faces, The Arm of Flesh</i> (revised as <i>Cassada</i>), and <i>The Hunters,</i> the memoirs <i>Gods of Tin </i>and <i>Burning the Days</i>, and the collection<i> Last Night.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Philip Gourevitch</b>&#x2019;s books have received numerous honors, including the National Book Critics Circle Award.

However, unlike most other rich <i>conquistadores</i> who returned to the land of their birth, Francisco was not allowed to settle into a life of leisure. Instead, he was charged with bigamy and illegal shipment of silver, was arrested and imprisoned. Francisco&#x2019;s first wife (thought long dead) had filed suit in Spain against her renegade husband.<br>So begins the labyrinthine legal tale and engrossing drama of an explorer and his two wives, skillfully reconstructed through the expert and original archival research of Alexandra Parma Cook and Noble David Cook. Drawing on the remarkable records from the trial, the narrative of Francisco&#x2019;s adventures provides a window into daily life in sixteenth-century Spain, as well as the <i>mentalit�</i> and experience of conquest and settlement of the New World. Told from the point of view of the conquerors, Francisco&#x2019;s story reveals not only the lives of the middle class and minor nobility but also much about those at the lower rungs of the social order and relations between the sexes.<br>In the tradition of Carlo Ginzberg&#x2019;s <i>The Cheese and the Worms</i> and Natalie Zemon Davis&#x2019; <i>The Return of Martin Guerre, Good Faith and Truthful Ignorance</i> illuminates an historical period&#x2014;the world of sixteenth-century Spain <i>and </i>Peru&#x2014;through the wonderful and unusual story of one man and his two wives.</p><p>&#39;A well-paced historical narrative illuminating the hidden recesses of private life in the two worlds of Europe and America.&#39;--J.H.

Kushner has demonstrated time and again his understanding of the human spirit. In this compassionate new work, his most personal since <i>When Bad Things Happen to Good People</i>, Kushner relates how his time as a twenty-first-century rabbi has shaped his senses of religion and morality. He elicits nine essential lessons from the sum of his teaching, study, and experience, offering a lifetime&#x2019;s worth of spiritual food for thought, pragmatic advice, inspiration for a more fulfilling life, and strength for trying times. <br><br> With fresh, vital insight into belief (&#x201c;there is no commandment in Judaism to believe in God&#x201d;), conscience (the Garden of Eden story as you&#x2019;ve never heard it), and mercy (forgiveness is &#x201c;a favor you do yourself, not an undeserved gesture to the person who hurt you&#x201d;), grounded in Kushner's brilliant readings of Scripture, history, and popular culture, <i>Nine Essential Things I&#x2019;ve Learned About Life</i> is compulsory reading from one of modern Judaism&#x2019;s foremost sages.<br><br> Distilling the wisdom of an extraordinary career, this profoundly inspiring yet practical guide to well-being is truly the capstone to Kushner&#x2019;s luminous oeuvre.</p><p><p><b>HAROLD S. KUSHNER</b> is rabbi laureate of Temple Israel in Natick, Massachusetts, having long served that congregation. He is best known as the author of <i>When Bad Things Happen to Good People</i>. This is his thirteenth book.<br></p>Chapter One<br><br> Lessons Learned Along the Way<br><br> <i>In the twenty-first century, the religious agenda will be set not by tradition&#x2019;s answers but by congregants&#x2019; questions.</i><br><br> For thirty years, I had the perfect job. I was a congrega�tional rabbi. I studied, I taught, I officiated at life-cycle events&#x2014;bar mitzvah services, weddings, and funerals&#x2014;trying to enhance the joy and mitigate the sorrow of those moments with my words and with elements of the Jewish tradition, all things I had been taught to do and felt good about doing. (I confess there was one other aspect of being a congregational rabbi that pleased me. I have read that the most frightening thing a person can contemplate, even more than the fear of death, is the fear of having to speak in public. That&#x2019;s not me. In a room where two hundred people are sitting and lis�tening and one person is standing and speaking, I will always be most comfortable being the one standing and speaking.)<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;m not sure how I ended up being a rabbi. It was never my intention growing up. I don&#x2019;t think it ever occurred to me, nor to my parents, who suggested regu�larly that they would like me to be a doctor. I entered college with no idea of what I would do professionally, hoping that college would give me a direction. My father was a successful businessman, which ruled that out as a career. I did not want to go into business and fail, dis�appointing my father, nor did I want to go into busi�ness and be more successful than my father (a highly unlikely outcome). I have known families in which that engendered not pride but resentment. <br> &nbsp;<br> I entered Columbia in 1951, listing my major as &#x201c;lib�eral arts,&#x201d; which left open all possibilities short of medi�cal school. I also took advantage of Columbia&#x2019;s proximity to the Jewish Theological Seminary, where my mother had studied to be a Hebrew teacher some twenty-five years earlier and where some of her most revered teach�ers still taught. The Seminary offered evening classes for students who wanted the education without seeking a career in Jewish professional life. <br> &nbsp;<br> In those evening classes, I came to recognize four or five familiar faces from my freshman classes at Colum�bia, and we bonded. We would come back from class and stay up late talking theology, trying to make sense of the Holocaust, details of which had just become widely known, and discussing what the State of Israel, founded just a few years earlier, would mean for Jewish life. Sev�eral of those friends were planning to study for the rab�binate, though none of them did. Only I ended up there. After graduating from Columbia in 1955, I enrolled in the Seminary&#x2019;s rabbinical school and emerged five years later as a Conservative rabbi.<br> &nbsp;<br> My spiritual life&#x2014;what I believe, teach, and prac�tice&#x2014;has been shaped in large measure by two sets of circumstances. The first was the home I grew up in and the synagogue my family and I attended. The rabbi at the Brooklyn Jewish Center was Israel Levinthal, recognized as one of the outstanding preachers of the American Jewish community. Stories circulated of how Orthodox Jews would walk over the Williamsburg Bridge from the Lower East Side to Brooklyn on Friday nights (as they could not take trains on the Sabbath) to hear Levinthal speak. The quip was that every newly ordained Conser�vative rabbi would head out to his first pulpit with two books in his luggage: the pocket guide to Jewish practice and the collected sermons of Israel Levinthal. To this day, I cannot sit down to write a sermon without feeling Rabbi Levinthal&#x2019;s presence looking over my shoulder to make sure I am being faithful to the text.<br> &nbsp;<br> I would describe the religion practiced in my home as &#x201c;observant but not compulsive.&#x201d; When we lit the Sabbath candles on a Friday night or observed the tra�ditional dietary rules about permitted and forbidden foods, I never had the sense that we were obeying a com�mand from a God who would be displeased with us if we had not done those things, nor did we obsess about&nbsp;the consequences of our inadvertently making a mistake. Rather, we felt we were making a statement about who we were as a family and, although I don&#x2019;t think the word would have occurred to any of us, we were bringing a measure of holiness into an ordinary middle-class home, turning mundane moments into appointments with God. I could not have predicted at the time that the concept of &#x201c;observant but not compulsive&#x201d; and the absence of a belief in a God who would punish us for&nbsp;disobedience would go on to become cornerstones of my personal and professional life.<br> &nbsp;<br> The second circumstance that shaped my religious outlook was the illness and death of our son, Aaron, from one of the world&#x2019;s rarest diseases, progeria, the &#x201c;rapid-aging&#x201d; syndrome, as I chronicled in my book <i>When Bad Things Happen to Good People</i>. It was in the presence of my sick and dying child that I discovered&nbsp;how inadequate the traditional perspective was that I had grown up with and had been taught, that God has His reasons, which we cannot comprehend or judge. It neither made sense of the suffering nor offered us much in the way of comfort. If I was to continue to serve as a rabbi and to honor my son&#x2019;s memory, I would have<br> to find a better explanation.<br> &nbsp;<br> I think of the first circumstance, the religion of&nbsp;my childhood home and synagogue, as &#x201c;religion done well,&#x201d; religion fashioning a community and introducing moments of specialness into an ordinary home. And I think of the second as my encounter with &#x201c;religion done badly,&#x201d; more concerned with protecting God&#x2019;s reputation than with helping worshippers in need. The notion that an all-wise, all-powerful God who is totally good must have had His reasons for inflicting incur�able illness on innocent children, reasons beyond the comprehension of a human mind or soul, was worse than unhelpful. It was offensive, saying to us either &#x201c;You must have done something to deserve this&#x201d; or &#x201c;In times to come, you will understand why this was the right thing to happen to you.&#x201d; I heard this from many people after my book came out: &#x201c;Now you know why God did this to your child, so that you would write this book that would help millions.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m sorry, but I choose to believe that any God worth worshipping would say, &#x201c;I really don&#x2019;t need you to be My press agent. I need you to bring solace and comfort to My bleeding children on earth.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> More than anything else, my half century of congre�gational service and my dozen or so books have been dedicated to reformulating that traditional theology. I&#x2019;ve done this not to protect God from bad theologians and people&#x2019;s righteous anger, but to rescue people who need God from having to choose between a cruel God and no God at all.<br> &nbsp;<br> I heard a story some years ago about a couple cel�ebrating their twentieth wedding anniversary by going out to dinner at a fancy restaurant. Leaving the restau�rant, they got into their car to drive home. The wife turned to the husband and said, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s happened to us over the years? Do you remember when we were court�ing, when we were first married, how we would get into the car and snuggle up close to each other, and drive somewhere holding on to each other? Now look how far apart we&#x2019;re sitting.&#x201d; And the husband responded by pointing to the steering wheel and saying, &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t moved.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> For many of us, there was a time when we were young when we felt close to God. We had been taught that God loved us and was watching over us, and that made us feel safe. We tried to be worthy of God&#x2019;s love and were troubled by guilt every time we told a lie or took something that didn&#x2019;t belong to us. When we learned of other people&#x2019;s suffering, as when my best friend died of a brain tumor when he was ten years old, we fell back on the assumption that God knows what is best for us better than we do. That childhood faith did not last. War, crime, serious illnesses affecting people we cared about, the emerging truth about the Holocaust, and the inevi�table disappointments of life cost us that simple faith of our childhood, and like the wife in the story, we found ourselves feeling distant from the God to whom we had once felt so close but now found unreliable. I hope that this book, born out of my own struggles with faith lost and recovered, will help to close that gap, to let us know that God has not moved but that we have come to see Him more clearly.<br> &nbsp;<br> My years at rabbinical school were an extraordinary intellectual feast. For four years (plus a year of indepen�dent study in Israel), I was confronted on a daily, if not hourly, basis by great minds, great scholars, men who dominated (and in some cases had created) their areas of expertise. I had the privilege three times a week of watch�ing the mind of Saul Lieberman analyze a puzzling page of the Talmud. I was introduced to a new level of bibli�cal scholarship, at once critical and reverent. And I met the man who would change my life, Mordecai Kaplan. Where my other professors had answers to text-related questions, Professor Kaplan had questions to challenge the answers we brought to class. He accomplished the Copernican revolution of moving the center of gravity in religion from divinely ordained observances to the collective will of the community. Judaism was what seri�ous Jews did, not what books described them as doing. Christianity would be defined by how Christians acted today, not by what medieval scholars wrote long ago. In the process of teaching me, he prepared me for the cri�sis that would arise from the one serious flaw in my otherwise excellent rabbinic education. More about that later.<br> &nbsp;<br> I was ordained a rabbi in June 1960. We gradu�ates were expected to give two years of service before we began our careers, in some position that would oth�erwise not be able to have a rabbi: a small congrega�tion, an organization serving the less fortunate, or the military chaplaincy. I made myself available to the chap�laincy. This country had been very good to my family, welcoming my parents when they immigrated from Lithuania, educating my brother and me, sending an army to defeat the Nazis before they could finish the destruction of European Jewry, and I felt I owed it some�thing for that. As a clergyman, I was exempt from the draft, so I had to go to court and have the exemption waived. I was commissioned a first lieutenant and, with my new bride of a few months, headed out to Fort Sill in Lawton, Oklahoma. <br> &nbsp;<br> It was in many ways a good experience. I had time to study. Every Monday, I would meet for lunch with the post psychiatrist, who was a member of my con�gregation there. He taught me how to understand and respond to the problems the GIs brought to me on a daily basis. And as a colleague of mine put it, as a new rabbi I got to make my rookie mistakes on congregants who did not have the power to fire me. <br> &nbsp;<br> I completed my two-year obligation, served a four-year apprenticeship in a major Long Island synagogue, and in the summer of 1966 assumed the pulpit of Tem�ple Israel in the Boston suburb of Natick. Soon enough, I discovered the strengths and the weaknesses of my seminary training. <br> &nbsp;<br> After years of intensive study of classical texts, I left school full of answers. The implicit message of my rabbinical school was: &#x201c;These answers are the essence of Judaism. If your congregants ask you questions to which these answers don&#x2019;t fit, educate them to ask more appropriate questions.&#x201d; Some of that worked. The meaning and emotional impact of the customs and usages of traditional Judaism can be magical, and I trust this holds true for other religions as well. Done right, they can transform a moment from ordinary to sublime. A wedding ceremony can be elevated from a mundane legal procedure to a celebration of the miracle of love and commitment, a human being entrusting his or her happiness to the care of another human being, giving parents and grandparents a glimpse into the promise of vicarious immortality. A bar mitzvah service done right (how often does that happen?) can be more than an elaborate birthday party. It can celebrate a child&#x2019;s crossing the threshold, being publicly recognized as an incipient adult, capable of mastering the skills required of adults in his community. A funeral is not simply the disposal of a dead body. It represents the gathering of the community to provide comfort to the bereaved in time-honored, time-tested ways, so that the mourner need not feel abandoned at a time when he or she is most prone to feeling abandoned.<br> &nbsp;<br> Congregants did come to me with questions, but most of their questions were not the ones my seminary training had prepared me for. I knew which prayers are recited at the Sabbath service, but I had no ready answer for the congregant who said to me, &#x201c;Saturday is the bus�iest day in my business. That&#x2019;s when I make most of the money to pay the bills at home. What right do you have to tell me to skip work and come to services instead?&#x201d; Or the parents who said to me, &#x201c;Little League baseball is the most important thing in our eleven-year-old son&#x2019;s life right now. If the temple makes Junior Congregation mandatory, we&#x2019;ll pull him out of Hebrew school before we take him out of Little League.&#x201d; (My answer: we&#x2019;ll see him in Junior Congregation when Little League season ends.) <br> &nbsp;<br> My Seminary education made me an authority on the Jewish dietary laws. I had a three-page printout of which fish had fins and scales and could be eaten by observant Jews, and which fish lacked them and were nonkosher. But I was rarely asked about that. I was more likely to be asked, &#x201c;Why do I have to restrict what I serve my family today based on which foods were not good to eat in the heat of the Sinai desert?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Those encounters taught me the first rule of religious life in the twenty-first century and what made it different from religious life in previous times. The agenda for religion today will be set not by yesterday&#x2019;s answers but by today&#x2019;s questions. I still believe there is great wisdom in yesterday&#x2019;s answers. Human nature has not changed that much. But my rabbinic education, splendid as it was, saw congregants as passive consum�ers of ancient and eternal truths. To be religious was to obey, not necessarily to understand, and certainly not to question. That perspective did not prepare me for a world in which the meaning of words like &#x201c;commitment,&#x201d; the structure of the family, issues of religious identity in an open society, and the respective roles of men and women were in flux. Those changes set in motion major changes in the way Jews and Christians alike responded to their respective religious traditions. Sociologists have identified the salient difference between working-class and middle-class people as a function of how much control someone has over his or her life. Working-class people, as well as women in premodern times, were accustomed to following orders, deferring to authority. By contrast, middle-class and upper-class people under�stand that it is not their obedience but their judgment that people look to them for. They feel they have not only the right but the obligation to question the way things have always been done.

That wondrous isle in the western seas.<br> <br>I came out of my mother feetfirst. I arrived kicking and pissed off, sticky with fury, soaked to the skin. I was what&#x2019;s known as a stargazing fetus as well, my neck fully extended. From the very beginning I was going against the grain and making trouble. Perhaps I was holding on to my mother for dear life, somehow knowing what was about to happen next. I didn&#x2019;t want to leave the one place I had felt at home, where I had been floating for so long, and enter the darkness. Inside, there was light. Outside, instantly, the unknown. The cord was cut. Startled by a strange newness, I didn&#x2019;t immediately make much of a noise, so I was slapped and slapped, to prove that I was normal. I cried out. I&#x2019;ll show you noise. I&#x2019;ll show you normal. I shrieked. In my own uprooted newborn way, I probably cursed.<br> <br>Here I am.<br> <br>Grace Beverly Jones. As was the custom, I would be known by my second name. Beverly. Bev. Later, when I was four or five, my skin was so charcoal black I would be engulfed when the warm, sultry night fell, throbbing with nature and a slithering hint of the supernatural. My nickname then was Firefly. You could only make out my eyes and teeth, sparkling in the dark.<br> <br>My new home outside my mother was Spanish Town, the oldest continually habituated town in Jamaica. Five hundred and fifty years of history, starting a few years after the island of Jamaica was first found&#x2014;&#x201c;discovered&#x201d;&#x2014;by a Christopher Columbus of Italy in charge of exploring and marauding Spaniards. As St. Jago de la Vega, the town on the plains, at the edge of wetlands in the south of the island, it became the capital when the Spanish settled. They gave it a distinct Spanish Colonial layout, with lots of internal courtyards and walled gardens and a Renaissance-influenced checkerboard of streets placed around a dramatic central plaza. Spanish interest in Jamaica waned when it became clear there was no gold, and it became a backwater of the Spanish Empire. It became Spanish Town in 1655 when the British conquered the island. They kept it as the administrative capital and introduced grand Georgian buildings, reflecting the growing empire&#x2019;s wealth and importance.<br> <br>Spanish Town was the Jamaican capital until the port of Kingston&#x2014;better placed on the coast thirteen miles away, with more natural vitality&#x2014;replaced it in 1872. The town&#x2019;s cathedral, built in the early sixteenth century, rebuilt in 1725 as an Anglican church, was the first such building in this part of the world and remains the oldest ecclesiastical structure from the British Empire still standing outside the UK. When I was born, Spanish Town had traces of grandeur but was showing signs of neglect after centuries of colonial rule and the Great Depression in the 1930s; imposed signs of methodical Spanish life, elegant town planning, and aristocratic British influences peeling back to reveal the undimmed Jamaica underneath. It had a faded glory, a shabby gentility, many parts of it cast aside as useless, and was beginning to meet up with the rough, tumbling edges of the capital city as Kingston&#x2019;s population grew.<br> <br>They say I&#x2019;m a lot older than I actually am. In the press, on the Internet, they add about four years to my actual age. I&#x2019;m often asked how old I am&#x2014;the world likes to know a person&#x2019;s age for some reason, as if that number explains everything. I don&#x2019;t care at all. I like to keep the mystery. I get onstage and tell everyone I am ten years older than they think, and then I hula-hoop for twenty minutes. That&#x2019;s my age&#x2014;that&#x2019;s how I measure it. I wasn&#x2019;t born wearing a watch, and I never got used to wearing one, and when I was born I didn&#x2019;t know if it was Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday, and I never really know the days of the week now. Days are days, hours come and go, in whatever order, and I keep up with it, in my own way. It&#x2019;s hard to remember things in the right order, but I will try.<br> <br>Time for me is an energy. I&#x2019;m another energy, and the two energies wrap around each other. The present can seem as distant as the past, which can seem as close as the present. The most exciting thing is what happens next, even if it has already happened.<br> <br>Because I never say my age, and rarely have to write it down, I roughly work it out by basing my life on an historic landmark. I mark time by what was happening in the world rather than how old I was. I remember moving to America around the time that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Before then, I was living in Jamaica, caged inside a certain goddamned darkness, even though there was so much sun and life. After Kennedy died, I was moving around like a gypsy, looking for the light, for what happens next.<br> <br>Every birthday party I had after my teens, I always said I was twenty-something. I would know I was thirty-something, maybe forty-something, but never really the exact age.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t grow older. I grew wiser. The world likes to know the age of someone, so I would be often asked. I am honestly never sure, so when it comes to working it out, to work out how old I am, I take something important, like my son&#x2019;s age, and if he is thirty-three, and I was, say, twenty-nine when I had him, then I do the math. So if you ask me now how old I am, nothing comes to mind straightaway. To some extent, it could be any number. Even then I am not entirely sure; it&#x2019;s not because I am hiding my age, embarrassed or annoyed by it, but because it is not something I keep to hand. It&#x2019;s not the most important thing about me. There are more important things about me than my age that will give you a better idea of who and what I am. I was born. Let&#x2019;s take it from there.<br> <br>I know just by knowing that the first decade of my life in Jamaica was during the 1950s. The Second World War had finished. It was a few years before Jamaica would win its independence from the British. Many Jamaicans were traveling to the mother country, Britain, to find a new life. To find new opportunities, my parents were preparing to move north, along the East Coast of North America.<br> <br>My mother was Marjorie, born in 1930; my father was Robert Winston, born six years earlier. They already had two young children when I was born. My mother was extremely fertile and there was no contraception at the time. Five of the children were born in very quick succession; one year, two were born. Lots of juices were flowing. The children kept coming. Robert Patrick was the first boy; later he would change his name to Christian, Chris. Then there Norman Noel, known as Noel. Then, back to front, me, Grace Beverly. After me, George Maxwell, Max. Another girl followed, Yvonne Pamela, and then another girl, Janet Marie. Eventually, there was a fourth son, Randy, born in America, not Jamaican at all, the baby of the family. When she married my dad, my mother was sixteen. By twenty-two, she had six kids. She was a Walters; her grandmother&#x2019;s maiden name, my great-grandmother, was Powell, and some in our family think the first African-American to serve as secretary of state, Colin Powell, might be a relation.<br> <br>They went to America to get away from her family as much as anything. My mom was definitely stifled by the world she grew up in. She was from a very religious family, among the first to open a Pentecostal church on the island. The very first Pentecostal church was opened in Spanish Town in 1933, three years after the first Pentecostal convention was held in Kingston. This was a missionary venture, a spreading of the word to those who felt estranged from standard religion, because they were too poor, or too otherwise troubled. There was a zeal among the converts based on a determination to be heard and followed; their evangelism was vigorous.<br> <br>Her uncle was a bishop in this church, Bishop Walters, tight-lipped, with a barren gaze. He was a dominating figure who made the church and its unforgiving belief system the center of the family&#x2019;s life. So I had a bishop grand-uncle whom I thought of growing up as the bishop of Jamaica.<br> <br>To some extent, his title was self-designated; his was a new untested religion, based on personal calling, its members making up its own rules, following other churches and their categories, so that the leaders became bishops, because that gave them the authority they craved. The Anglicans had bishops; so too would the Pentecostalists. This was one of the attractions of this new religion, that ordinary working people and the lower middle class, who felt snubbed by British and Europe-based churches and their elitism, could claim for themselves a superior religious standing. There were new opportunities for lay and ministerial leadership, which was very attractive. To climb to the top of other religions from a lowly position would take a miracle. Here was a chance to form small communities that could be organized from within, often from within families, instead of having to look to other countries and governments for leadership. There was a whole dynasty of bishops in my family; we are the bishop royal family of Jamaica. I am not sure where I fit into this, although to some extent I have about as much right to call myself a bishop as my grand-uncle Bishop Walters did.<br> <br>Religion was a way for many Jamaicans to challenge the white-maintained status quo, from eighteenth-century slaves to twentieth-century Rastafarians. It was also a way for those less motivated to resist accepting things as they were. They have every church you can imagine in Jamaica. It&#x2019;s said that there are the largest number of churches per square mile there than in any other country in the world; it seems like there is a church on every street corner. And some religions are more religious than others.<br> <br>How successful a church is depends how charismatic your pastor is. It&#x2019;s all about aura. It&#x2019;s about conviction. How deeply you believe. My grand-uncle Bishop Walters was an obsessive believer, made religion his whole world and the world of everyone around him. He was in his own way a brilliant performer, and performing is at the heart of the Pentecostal appeal. Jamaicans could identify with that; it is a society of physical performance.<br> <br>He had an illegitimate son before he joined the church, and he kicked him out, because he didn&#x2019;t fit into his new life. The son grew up in England. We were good friends and I used to see him, but to the family it was as though he never existed. You could easily be cut out and cut off. They take religion to an insane, intimidating extreme, using the Bible, and God, to create a world that they can run in their own image.<br> <br>Pentecostalism became my religion, as it had been for my mother, because that&#x2019;s what I grew up with. I had no choice. In our religion, according to my bishop grand-uncle, if you strayed, you would be thrown out, into a terrible, hellish exile. They took the Bible literally, all those revamped Babylonian folktales. Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth. If your right hand offends thee, cut it off. If members of your family do wrong, shun them. Kick them out. Ignore them. &#x201c;All scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, for refutation, for correction, and for training in righteousness&#x201d; (2 Timothy 3:16.). The leaders of the religion&#x2014;the bishops, the pastors&#x2014;ruled with fear, with a rod of iron. Perhaps they justified it to themselves because in the Bible it says that you have to use the rod to correct a child. We had to read that passage out a lot, as though the fact we were saying it in our child voices made it definitive.<br> <br>My father&#x2019;s side of the family, the Joneses, were politicians and administrators. They brought the first books to Jamaica and started the library system on the island. His sister, my aunt Sybil, became the head librarian of the National Library of Jamaica in Kingston.<br> <br>My father was a very good-looking man, and was very strong, mentally and physically. He was a keen amateur boxer and studied at Dint Hill Agricultural College. Farming was a major source of employment in the area; domestic and commercial crops included bananas, coconuts, pumpkins, peppers, and coffee, and there had been sugar plantations since the Spanish arrived bringing sugarcane with them from Haiti. After the British arrived, the island was turned into one big sugar plantation. The world craved sugar. There was a lack of local labor, and new workers were desperately needed. Africans were found to be excellent workers, experienced with the land, and used to laboring in a tropical climate. Thousands of them were shipped in against their will. To keep the world sweet, Britain took sugar-producing Jamaica as another jewel in its crown, becoming the largest slave-trading country in the world. The cultivation of sugar and the organization of slavery were intimately tangled up.<br> <br>My father&#x2019;s family were strict in different ways from the religious way&#x2014;theirs was an army way. My grandfather on his side, his father, Arthur Patrick, born at the end of the nineteenth century, was a sergeant in the army during the First World War. When Britain entered the war, thousands of colonial men were enlisted in the British West Indies Regiment.<br> <br>They gave land in Jamaica to anyone who volunteered for the Great War. His land was in the cool, isolated, shamrock-green hills that seem to hover under misty clouds, up above Sligoville, a humble, laid-back village steeped in its own gentle rhythms. It was the first free village in Jamaica, divided in 1835, after the Emancipation Act started to free slaves, into small, hilly lots for ex-slaves to live in.<br> <br>Before then, the area had been a haven for escaping slaves, who had been stolen from the mountains in one land and now found sanctuary in the mountains of another. It was very near Pinnacle in St. Jago, the home of the first self-sustaining Rastafarian settlement organized by the founding father of the movement, Leonard P. Howell. Landless Rastafarians would leave the spread-eagled concrete jungle of Kingston and head for the hills. It was a place that yielded rich crops, including, of course, ganja. It&#x2019;s the spiritual home of the Rastas, seen by them as a sacred site, and you could say what became reggae, and Bob Marley, and the whole idea of &#x201c;one love&#x201d; began on that secluded rocky hilltop.<br> <br>There is something in the air up there, and in the earth, and it remained mostly untouched by the Spanish and the British. It was too remote and hilly to build there. Even the Native American Tainos who occupied the land at the time of the Spanish arrival were situated near the coastline and adjacent to life-giving lowland rivers.<br> <br>My grandfather had a house in Sligoville among a few other houses strewn about that, from a distance, seemed to be abandoned. There are plenty of dirt tracks that lead nowhere, there are acres of gentle sloping land, and the views to Kingston across the hills and the plains of St. Catherine are spectacular. The island beckons in all directions. It&#x2019;s a less familiar Jamaica for many, away from the heavenly shorelines and the overexposed and protected tourist attractions. The Jones family still has some land there, quietly waiting for us, as if this serene, magical place between the rolling mountains and the wide, wide sky is our destiny. Maybe one day I will think of this place as home. I&#x2019;ll walk barefoot in the grass alongside a river unmoved by time, letting things flow forward in whatever w...</p><h2>The Times Atlas of the Second World War</h2><p>Hundreds of color maps and photographs cover every campaign of World War II in every theater, accompanied by a chronology of events, an encyclopedic glossary, and an analysis of the war&#39;s social, political, and economic contexts</p><p>Keegan and his distinguished team of consultants have produced a model atlas of a complex subject. The book's core is its operational maps. Technically well executed, they are complex but never confusing, and provide a comprehensive graphic survey of the war's major and minor fronts and theaters. This is complemented by sophisticated presentations on such less-obvious subjects for an atlas as resistance, intelligence, and special operations. The accompanying texts, spare but not simplistic, reflect state-of-the-art scholarship.

From well-covered stories like the Stuxnet attack which helped slow Iran's nuclear program, to lesser-known tales like EternalBlue, the 2017 cyber battle that closed hospitals in Britain and froze shipping crates in Germany in midair, we have entered an age in which online threats carry real-world consequences. But we do not have to let autocrats and criminals run amok in the digital realm. We now know a great deal about how to make cyberspace far less dangerous--and about how to defend our security, economy, democracy, and privacy from cyber attack. <br><br>This is a book about the realm in which nobody should ever want to fight a war: the fifth domain, the Pentagon's term for cyberspace. Our guides are two of America's top cybersecurity experts, seasoned practitioners who are as familiar with the White House Situation Room as they are with Fortune 500 boardrooms. Richard A. Clarke and Robert K. Knake offer a vivid, engrossing tour of the often unfamiliar terrain of cyberspace, introducing us to the scientists, executives, and public servants who have learned through hard experience how government agencies and private firms can fend off cyber threats. <br><br>Clarke and Knake take us inside quantum-computing labs racing to develop cyber superweapons; bring us into the boardrooms of the many firms that have been hacked and the few that have not; and walk us through the corridors of the U.S. intelligence community with officials working to defend America's elections from foreign malice. With a focus on solutions over scaremongering, they make a compelling case for "cyber resilience"--building systems that can resist most attacks, raising the costs on cyber criminals and the autocrats who often lurk behind them, and avoiding the trap of overreaction to digital attacks. <br><br>Above all, Clarke and Knake show us how to keep the fifth domain a humming engine of economic growth and human progress by not giving in to those who would turn it into a wasteland of conflict. Backed by decades of high-level experience in the White House and the private sector, <i>The Fifth Domain</i> delivers a riveting, agenda-setting insider look at what works in the struggle to avoid cyberwar.</p><p><b>Richard A. Clarke</b> is one of the world's leading experts on security, cyberspace, and terrorism. He served in the U.S. government for thirty years, including as White House counterterrorism coordinator under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, and became the first White House official placed in charge of U.S. cybersecurity policy. He is the author of eight books (four works of nonfiction and four novels), including the number-one national bestseller <i>Against All Enemies: Inside America's War on Terror</i>. <br><br><b>Robert K. Knake</b> is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, a senior research scientist at Northeastern University, and an adviser to startups, investment firms, and Fortune 500 companies.

He is the co-author (with Clarke) of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Cyber War</i>.&#x201c;A sobering but hopeful exploration of defenses against the weaponization of the internet . . . Clarke and Knake, drawing on interviews with experts, explain cybersecurity&#x2019;s intricacies in a lucid, engaging manner that avoids the alarmism that often surrounds the subject. The result is a fine survey that will interest policy makers, executives, and ordinary readers alike.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b> <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Clarke and Knake, both of whom logged time inside the cybersecurity arms of presidential administrations, have much to say about the ways in which governments and companies have tried to make themselves safe from the legions of hackers out there, from your ordinary black hats to agents of Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, and other entities. . . . The authors counsel reassuringly [that] as companies finally make the transition to more secure systems of transmission, encryption, and data storage, there is hope that the threats of old will one day be a footnote. . . .

This well-organized and -illustrated guide, which incorporates the latest in component technology and innovations, shows how to maintain every part of a road bike. This includes chains, derailleurs, shifters, wheels, brakes, cranks, bottom brackets, pedals, saddles, seatposts, handlebars, stems, headsets, forks, and frames &#x2014; all covered in Lennard Zinn&#x2019;s trademark clear and concise prose. Novices and seasoned mechanics alike can benefit from the clear illustrations, exploded views of how components go together, and practical tips on how to completely and properly maintain all aspects of their road bikes to ensure hours of trouble-free riding. Zinn shows exactly when to tackle a maintenance project and when a trip to the bike shop for repair is unavoidable.</p><p>Lennard Zinn explains that it doesn't take special skills to learn how to care for one's bike, only "a passion for spreading new grease on old parts." Clearly, his ambition is to share with newcomers the Zen-like joy of bike maintenance. But it's seasoned bike mechanics that should be tripping over each other for a copy of this comprehensive and ambitious manual. <i>Zinn</i> differs from other how-to books by guiding readers--with plain-speaking text--through almost every imaginable repair on almost every imaginable part. He covers everything from rebuilding hubs, to loosening seized stems, to installing six different types of bottom brackets. He even risks cycling blasphemy by walking mere mortals through the art of wheel building--an intimidating task that can take years to perfect. Although best suited for the old pros, his guide is user- friendly, funny, and essential to <i>anyone</i> willing to love their bike. <i>--Ben Tiffany</i>Zinn is a bicycle framebuilder, a technical writer, avid cyclist and bike lover.

Now, more than thirty years later, Giovanni still stands as one of the most commanding, luminous voices to grace America's political and poetic landscape.</p><p>The first of its kind, this omnibus collection covers Nikki Giovanni's complete work of poetry from three decades, 1968&#x2013;1998. <em>The Collected Poetry of Nikki Giovanni</em> contains Giovanni's first seven volumes of poetry: <em>Black Feeling Black Talk, Black Judgement, Re: Creation, My House, The Women and the Men, Cotton Candy on a Rainy Day</em>, and <em>Those Who Ride the Night Winds</em>. Arranged chronologically with a biographical timeline and introduction, a new afterword from the author, title and first-line indexes, and extensive notes to the poems, this collection is the testimony of a life's work -- from one of America's most beloved daughters and powerful poets.</p><p>Known for their iconic revolutionary phrases, <em>Black Feeling Black Talk</em> (1968), <em>Black Judgement</em> (1968), and <em>Re: Creation</em> (1970) are heralded as being among the most important volumes of contemporary poetry. <em>My House</em> (1972) marks a new dimension in tone and philosophy -- it signifies a new self-confidence and maturity as Giovanni artfully connects the private and the public, the personal and the political. In <em>The Women and the Men</em> (1975), Giovanni displays her compassion for the people, things, and places she has encountered -- she reveres the ordinary and is in search of the extraordinary. <em>Cotton Candy on a Rainy Day</em> (1978) is one of the most poignant and introspective. These poems chronicle the drastic change that took place during the 1970s -- in both the consciousness of the nation and in the soul of the poet -- when the dreams of the Civil Rights era seemed to have evaporated. <em>Those Who Ride the Night Winds</em> (1983) is devoted to "the day trippers and midnight cowboys," the ones who have devoted their lives to pushing the limits of the human condition and shattering the constraints of the status quo.</p><p>Each volume reflects the changes Giovanni has endured as a Black woman, lover, mother, teacher, and poet. A timeless classic, <em>The Collected Poetry of Nikki Giovanni</em> is the evocation of a nation's past and present -- intensely personal and fiercely political -- from one of our most compassionate, vibrant observers.</p></p><p><p>Nikki Giovanni, poet, activist, mother, and professor, is a seven-time NAACP Image Award winner and the first recipient of the Rosa Parks Woman of Courage Award, and holds the Langston Hughes Medal for Outstanding Poetry, among many other honors. The author of twenty-eight books and a Grammy nominee for <em>The Nikki Giovanni Poetry Collection</em>, she is the University Distinguished Professor of English at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia.</p>With the initially self-published Black Feeling Black Talk (1968) and the same year's Black Judgment, the then 25-year-old Giovanni helped take the Black Arts Movement to national prominence, including TV appearances, a top-selling spoken-word LP, and nine books (counting interviews and anthologies) in the next six years. Giovanni's fiery yet personal early voice struck many listeners as the authentic sound of black militancy: "This is a crazy country," one poem explained, "But we can't be Black/ And not be crazy"; "White degrees do not qualify negroes to run/ The Black Revolution." The '70s saw Giovanni move toward more personal or private concerns: "touching was and still is and will always be the true/ revolution," she concluded in 1972, suggesting a few years later "We gulp when we realize/ There are few choices in life/ That are clear." This volume compiles not all Giovanni's poems but those of her first seven volumes, from Black Feeling to Those Who Ride the Night Winds (1983), which introduced her later "lineless" style ("This is not a poem... this is hot chocolate at the beginning of spring"). Her outspoken advocacy, her consciousness of roots in oral traditions, and her charismatic delivery place her among the forebearers of present-day slam and spoken-word scenes. Virginia C. Fowler provides an ample and diligent introduction, chronology and notes to individual works. Giovanni's planned reading tour for 2003-2004 includes the Javits Center in Manhattan and convention centers in D.C., Philadelphia and Miami-one sign of her unusually large fan base. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Starting where A NIXIE&#39;S SONG ended, the story has Nick and Laurie facing a calamitous invasion of giants. When the giants burn down their housing development, Nick and Laurie turn to the mermaids for advice. The rippling, echoing voices of the cruel mermaids add an exotic element to the audio performance. McCarthy distinguishes each character so that dialogue is clear. He performs action sequences with equal aplomb. Sometimes he seems to read rapidly, almost stumbling in his haste. However, his pace matches the fast pace of the story.

This one is unlike the majority: it specifically identifies 16 "master archetypes," complete with thumbnail sketches and descriptions of specific qualities, flaws, background, styles, and possible occupations. The authors, all writers and writing instructors, detail eight male and eight female archetypes in Sections 1 and 2 and then in Section 3 discuss how the characters can interact and evolve, often warning that "a writer cannot simply lift the archetypes from these pages." Although these archetypes from these pages." Although these archetypes are admittedly rather stereotypical (e.g., the Chief, the Bad Boy, and the Warrior, or the Seductress, the Waif, and the Nurturer), the book does provide a thought-provoking exploration of character development and its myriad possibilities. Useful examples from literature, television, and cinema are included in the appendex. Although the book is written in an easily accessible writing style, it nevertheless contains more detail than would be needed for most undergraduate programs. It is therefore more suitable for advanced creative writing programs. Recommended for midsize to larger public libraries.<br><i>Angela M.

The much-anticipated, explosive expose of how cell phone use damages brain cells, especially in children, by one of the world&#39;s foremost scientific experts in the field. Devra Davis presents an array of recent and long suppressed research in this timely bombshell. Cell phone radiation is a national emergency. Stunningly, the most popular gadget of our age has now been shown to damage DNA, break down the brain&#39;s defenses, and reduce sperm count while increasing memory loss, the risk of Alzheimer&#39;s disease, and even cancer. The growing brains of children make them especially vulnerable. And half of the world&#39;s four billion cell phone used by people under twenty.

In DISCONNECT, she argues that radiation from excessive cell phone use may be related to brain tumors and male infertility. Even skeptical listeners should find this audiobook fair-minded, as Davis lays out the evidence and avoids overstating her case. It&#39;s a shame that Emily Durante&#39;s narration clashes so badly with Davis&#39;s writing. Durante is usually a strong narrator of fiction, but her tone and delivery are at odds with this material. Unfortunately, the real disconnect here is between author and narrator.

BOMC Dual Main.</p><p>The upper stratum of New York society into which <b>Edith Wharton</b> was born in 1862 provided her with an abundance of material as a novelist but did not encourage her growth as an artist. Educated by tutors and governesses, she was raised for only one career: marriage. But her marriage, in 1885, to Edward Wharton was an emotional disappointment, if not a disaster. She suffered the first of a series of nervous breakdowns in 1894. In spite of the strain of her marriage, or perhaps because of it, she began to write fiction and published her first story in 1889.Her first published book was a guide to interior decorating, but this was followed by several novels and story collections. They were written while the Whartons lived in Newport and New York, traveled in Europe, and built their grand home, the Mount, in Lenox, Massachusetts. In Europe, she met Henry James, who became her good friend, traveling companion, and the sternest but most careful critic of her fiction.&nbsp;<i>The House of Mirth</i><b>&nbsp;</b>(1905) was both a resounding critical success and a bestseller, as was&nbsp;<i>Ethan Frome</i><b>&nbsp;</b>(1911). In 1913 the Whartons were divorced, and Edith took up permanent residence in France.&nbsp;Her subject, however, remained America, especially the moneyed New York of her youth. Her great satiric novel,&nbsp;<i>The Custom of the Country</i><b>&nbsp;</b>was published in 1913 and&nbsp;<i>The Age of Innocence</i>&nbsp;won her the Pulitzer Prize in 1921.In her later years, she enjoyed the admiration of a new generation of writers, including Sinclair Lewis and F. Scott Fitzgerald. In all, she wrote some 30 books, including an autobiography,&nbsp;<i>A Backward Glance</i>&nbsp;(1934). She died at her villa near Paris in 1937.<br><br><b>Marion Mainwaring</b>&nbsp;(1922-2015) was an Edith Wharton scholar most notable for having completed Wharton&#x2019;s unfinished manuscript <i>The Buccaneers </i>in 1993.

As I lay upon my back, a helpless, whining toddler, she lowered her head to nuzzle me. Like the falling of night her great dark head pushed away the pale sky, for she was all I could see. Warm gusts from her giant nostrils blew across my face. Silky black hide, stretched over bony sun and shadow, framed liquid eyes. I stared into their depths. Like black water on a moonless night, they hid what lay beneath, yet drew me in, breathless. </p><p>I think that in that moment I did hold my breath, stopped crying.Then the mare lifted her hoof, passing it over my head, and moved on. She picked her way daintily now, as if fearful of crushing a flower. But there it was already-my crushed foot.</p><p>With the rushing pain came the blood; with the blood, the screams. I remember my mother hurriedly wrapping my foot in a silk sash of pale blue-the color of good luck. The blood seeped through anyway, warm and wet, and I could smell it.

During the last fifteen years of his life he won for himself the reading public, first in France, then in Germany and America, and finally in England. In his funeral oration the spokesman of the most artistic and critical of European nations, Ernest Renan, hailed him as one of the greatest writers of our times: &#39;The Master, whose exquisite works have charmed our century, stand more than any other man as the incarnation of the whole race&#39;, because &#39;a whole world lived in him and spoke through his mouth&#39;. Not the Russian world only, we may add, but the whole Slavonic world, to which it was &#39;an honour to have been expressed by so great a Master&#39;. As regards his method of dealing with his material and shaping it into mould, he stands even higher than as a pure creator. Tolstoy is more plastical, and certainly as deep and original and rich in creative power as Turgenev, and Dostoevsky is more intense, fervid, and dramatic. But as an artist, as master of the combination of details into a harmonious whole, as an architect of imaginative work, he surpasses all the prose writers of his country, and has but few equals among the great novelists of other lands. To one familiar with all Turgenev&#39;s works it is evident that he possessed the keys of all human emotions, all human feelings, the highest and the lowest, the novel as well as the base. But there was in him such a love of light, sunshine, and living human poetry, such an organic aversion for all that is ugly, or coarse and discordant, that he makes himself almost exclusively the poet of the gentler side of human nature. We may say that the description of love is Turgenev&#39;s speciality.</p><p><b>Ivan Sergeyevich Turgenev</b> was born in 1818 in the Province of Orel, and suffered during his childhood from a tyrannical mother. After the family had moved to Moscow in 1827 he entered Petersburg University where he studied philosophy. When he was nineteen he published his first poems and, convinced that Europe contained the source of real knowledge, went to the University of Berlin. After two years he returned to Russia and took his degree at the University of Moscow. In 1843 he fell in love with Pauline Garcia-Viardot, a young Spanish singer, who influenced the rest of his life; he followed her on her singing tours in Europe and spent long periods in the French house of herself and her husband, both of whom accepted him as a family friend. He sent his daughter by a sempstress to be brought up among the Viardot children. After 1856 he lived mostly abroad, and he became the first Russian writer to gain a wide reputation in Europe; he was a well-known figure in Parisian literary circles, where his friends included Flaubert and the Goncourt brothers, and an honorary degree was conferred on him at Oxford. His series of six novels reflect a period of Russian life from 1830s to the 1870s: they are <b>Rudin</b> (1855), <b>A House of Gentlefolk</b> (1858), <b>On the Eve</b> (1859; a Penguin Classic), <b>Fathers and Sons</b> (1861), <b>Smoke</b> (1867) and <b>Virgin Soil</b> (1876). He also wrote plays, which include the comedy <b>A Month in the Country</b>; short stories and <b>Sketches from a Hunter&#x2019;s Album</b> (a Penguin Classic); and literary essays and memoirs. He died in Paris in 1883 after being ill for a year, and was buried in Russia.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Russian</p><h2>The Feast of Fools: A Theological Essay on Festivity and Fantasy</h2><p><p> In this fascinating interpretation of contemporary culture and theology, Harvey Cox examines both the loss and reemergence of festivity and fantasy in Western civilization. He evaluates both processes from a theological perspective, defining festivity as the capacity for genuine revelry and joyous celebration and defining fantasy as the faculty for envisioning radically alternative life situations. He asserts that both are absolutely vital to contemporary human life and faith; both are a precondition for genuine social transformation. In a success and money-oriented society we need a rebirth of unapologetically unproductive festivity and expressive celebration. In an age that has quarantined parody and separated politics from imagination, we need a renaissance of social fantasy. </p><p> It has been said over and over again that affluent Western man has been gaining the whole world while losing his soul. In the face of this Mr. Cox affirms the possibility and necessity of a resurgence of hope, celebration, liberation, and experimentation. The medieval Feast of Fools, from which he has taken his title, symbolizes both the problem and the process. Centuries ago it provided an opportunity for the choirboy to play bishop and for serious townsfolk to mock the stately rituals of church and court. The eventual disappearance of the custom in the sixteenth century, unlamented if not welcomed by those in authority, illustrates the concerns of this provocative and controversial essay. Mr. Cox does not propose that a medieval practice should be revived, but he does argue for a rebirth in our own cultural idiom of what was right and good about the Feast of Fools. </p><p> It is likely that this book will become significant in wide circles. It speaks directly to such contemporary movements as the theology of hope, the rapidly disappearing radical theology, and the theology of culture. For many it will provide a new perspective on the renewal of religious life and the secular search for religious experience. For others it will function as a window into the experimental laboratories of the so-called "underground church." For everyone it is a refreshing encounter with a wholly new set of perceptive observations about the problems that plague us. </p></p><p><b>Harvey Cox</b> is Professor of Divinity at Harvard University.</p><h2>The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey</h2><p><p></p> <br><p></p> <b>Unabridged, 7 CDs, 8 hours</b><br><br> Read by TBA<br><br> A masterful, moving novel about age, memory, and family that will forever establish Walter Mosley as one of the true literary icons of our time.<br><br></p><p>Walter Mosley is one of America&#x2019;s most celebrated, beloved, and bestselling writers.

Jones examines the central question of our own war: how did an insurgency develop? Following the September 11 attacks, the United States successfully overthrew the Taliban regime. It established security throughout the country&#x2015;killing, capturing, or scattering most of al Qa&#x2019;ida&#x2019;s senior operatives&#x2015;and Afghanistan finally began to emerge from more than two decades of struggle and conflict. But Jones argues that as early as 2001 planning for the Iraq War siphoned off resources and talented personnel, undermining the gains that had been made. After eight years, he says, the United States has managed to push al Qa&#x2019;ida&#x2019;s headquarters about one hundred miles across the border into Pakistan, the distance from New York to Philadelphia.<br><br> While observing the tense and often adversarial relationship between NATO allies in the Coalition, Jones&#x2015;who has distinguished himself at RAND and was recently named by <em>Esquire</em> as one of the &#x201c;Best and Brightest&#x201d; young policy experts&#x2015;introduces us to key figures on both sides of the war. Harnessing important new research and integrating thousands of declassified government documents, Jones then analyzes the insurgency from a historical and structural point of view, showing how a rising drug trade, poor security forces, and pervasive corruption undermined the Karzai government, while Americans abandoned a successful strategy, failed to provide the necessary support, and allowed a growing sanctuary for insurgents in Pakistan to catalyze the Taliban resurgence.<br><br> Examining what has worked thus far&#x2015;and what has not&#x2015;this serious and important book underscores the challenges we face in stabilizing the country and explains where we went wrong and what we must do if the United States is to avoid the disastrous fate that has befallen many of the great world powers to enter the region. 12 maps and charts</p><p>Praise for <em>In the Graveyard of Empires</em><br><br> &#x201c;Seth Jones . . . has an anthropologist&#x2019;s feel for a foreign society, a historian&#x2019;s intuition for long-term trends, and a novelist&#x2019;s eye for the telling details that illuminate a much larger story.

In this epic account of an extraordinary life lived during remarkable times, Jay Kirk follows the adventures of the brooding genius who revolutionized taxidermy and created the famed African Hall we visit today at New York's Museum of Natural History. The Gilded Age was drawing to a close, and with it came the realization that men may have hunted certain species into oblivion. Renowned taxidermist Carl Akeley joined the hunters rushing to Africa, where he risked death time and again as he stalked animals for his dioramas and hobnobbed with outsized personalities of the era such as Theodore Roosevelt and P.

BEFORE HIS LIFE HAD EVEN BEGUN, TO BE cast out and condemned to sit day in, day out in this basement dungeon before a great pile of dead birds? It was like a bad dream. The pile, heaped on the table, never got any smaller. He might think for a while that it was shrinking. He'd work his way into one corner for a while, skinning birds in one particular quadrant, digging a small cave, chipping away at the side of the mountain one dead bird at a time, but then another plume hunter would arrive in his muddy hip boots with a sack over his shoulder, stinking of gunpowder and bird shit. Then Wallace, the ogre who owned this dismal chop shop, would step out of the shadows to negotiate a price, and another sack of terns and egrets and robins and warblers would come tumbling out on the table, and the work would be just as daunting and endless as before.He had really flubbed his one great chance to have ended up here. One day you've got your whole life ahead of you; the next you're condemned for an eternity to keep pushing yourself back up a mountain of dead birds. It was the most barbaric work in the world, skinning birds for ladies' hats. It was a world away from the future he'd been promised at Ward's Natural Science Establishment in Rochester, New York. There he might have eventually seen his own handiwork end up in the world'sgreatest natural history museums. But then there'd been a kind of misunderstanding. He'd been too ambitious. He'd been too careless, and yes, possibly even arrogant. Mistakes were made. And then Professor Ward--the great maestro--had gone and cast him out of the only Eden he'd ever known. He'd been fired.And now Carl Akeley was a virtual prisoner in this dank basement of a moldy warehouse below the Brooklyn Bridge, where he could barely hear his own gloomy thoughts over the screech of tugboat whistles and the drone of the oil barges and naval vessels that crowded the East River. The sickening stench of the workshop, lit by the sallow light of gas jet lamps, was ghoulish. John Wallace was a short, intense man with a cockney accent often thickened by beer as he lorded it over his underground realm, dealing brashly with the hunters who brought him birds by the sackload daily, and the boys who worked for him, turning the flightless lumps of feather into cash.Carl and several other young men came in the morning before sunup, hung their coats by the door, and sat on wooden benches around a large table heaped with the day's work. The hunters came in from the rookeries on Long Island and the forests of New Jersey, bringing in as many as four hundred birds a day. They were dumped onto the table--bluebirds, sparrows, grebes, waxwings, all mixed together in a welter of beaks and bloodied plumage. Carl would reach into the heap, where it was sometimes still warm in the center, take hold of a bird, skin it, quickly shape it into something that might look chic on a lady's head, and then move on to the next. The boys' fingers were nicked and scratched and bled from the sharp talons and sewing needles. Loose feathers dusted the floor in drifts. At best, the work was a sort of assembly line: One boy skinned a bird, passed it along to the next, who wound tow for the body. Another bent wire for the necks; another cleaned wings with turpentine. Another might poison skins all day long. In the end they were dried, boxed, and shipped off to the milliners in the fashion district of Fourteenth Street, where they were affixed to ladies' hats for J. Gurney &amp; Son, the New York Millinery Supply Co., and others. Given how this peculiar fashion was at its absolute zenith, Mr. Wallace had earned a reputation as the most prolific stuffer of birds in the long and sordid history of taxidermy. He always had need for skilled and semiskilled boys.Akeley had had no trouble getting the job.To sit before this avalanche of dead birds that would never grow any smaller--this was his punishment for having had the temerity to try to make something of himself. The worst part was the stinging regret that never went away, that never got smaller, that stared back at him out of a thousand cooled eyes. If only Professor Ward had given him a chance to explain himself! Working at Ward's Natural Science Establishment had been the closest he would ever get to serious museum taxidermy. His only crime had been youthful ambition. Well, that, and falling asleep on the job; but Carl felt certain Professor Ward would have been kinder if only he'd known about the late-night experiments he'd been conducting, if he'd only bothered to ask before giving him the boot. If only whichever envious snake hadn't destroyed his experiments before he'd had the chance to show the professor. He'd actually thought he was on the verge of reinventing the art of taxidermy. How stupid he'd been. There was nothing artful about this work. It was brutal and disgusting. He was no sculptor, like he'd boasted. He was a nobody. That was all there was to it, and all that was left was to accept the fact that he'd been sentenced to a lifetime of utter insignificance--<i>skinning birds for ladies' hats</i>.Things could have turned out so differently! He thought of all the countless hours he'd spent as a boy cloistered in his room, studying the spattered copy of the taxidermy manual ordered from the back of <i>Youth's Companion</i>--he'd passed right over the ads for the Velocipede and the Reading Machine, even if he did go in for the adventure stories where explorers faced off against rabid panthers and savage Indians, the serialized features like "Cast Away in Japan"--the ad had been right there between the flexible rubber mittens and a kit for becoming a licensed telegraphy operator. Price one dollar. As small as a chapbook of poems, the book was bound by a dark brown cloth cover with gold embossed letters that read, simply, <i>Taxidermist's Manual.</i> The author was a Professor J. W. P. Jenks. Taking heed of the manual's first and primary admonition to work in secret so that "none may know the mysteries of the art," he had hidden himself in his room to begin his experimentations. Under his bed and crowding every free surface, splayed on sheets of newsprint, were the victims of his education. On his window ledge rested the frail skeletons of chipmunks, robins, and defleshed wrens bleaching in the sun. His desk was littered with awls and thread and scissors and pins--much of which had been pilfered from his mother'ssewing basket. In the summer, flies thrummed outside his open window but seemed to know better than to light on any of the still lifes inside; however tantalizing they may have looked, the poison that preserved the illusion of life had a tendency to ward off intruders.PREPARATION.To 1/2 pt. of 60 per cent. alcohol add an ounce each of arsenic, camphor, alum, and two drs. strychnine.

It is then fit for use.Label "Poison," and keep the bottle well corked.&nbsp;<br>(Ingredients easily obtained from Bishop's Drug Store)To Carl, this was more than a hobby. It was liberation. An escape from the pall that hung over the house, cast by the ghosts of his three dead infant brothers and his mother's grief, which kept her trapped in its dark weeds. Something "unnatural" had happened to this house, to this family. A friction had grown over the years, and his mother, more and more, put the blame on Carl's father, turning all her bitterness toward him, castrating him for failing to give her a life as good as her well-to-do and puritanical sisters'. Even though it had been she who refused to go west, as her husband wanted, to make a better go, to be free of their "clay slab" of a farm. But she did not want to leave her sisters, her family. She'd already lost enough. Blaming her husband only got easier once he'd lost his nerve and made the foolish mistake of paying another man a thousand dollars to go fight in the Civil War in his place. The substitute survived the war and lived long enough to collect interest on the debt for many years, further sinking them into poverty, and each season the farm grew more crabbed and worn-out.Perhaps his mother had become so numbed by her own melancholy, which now trailed from her pores like a noxious gas, that she didn't notice the stench that had taken over the upstairs of her home. But at some point one of the sisters, Carl's aunt, who lived just down the street, became alarmed at the way the boy was turning into a pale, unwholesome thing, and how his mother was doing nothing to stop it. A thirteen-year-old shouldn't spend all his time hiding in his bedroom, she said, doing God knows what to those poor animals. Young Carl had heard the whispers, eavesdropping at the top of the stairs, while his aunt conspired to rob him of his chief pleasure in life. It was an unnatural obsession.A disgusting habit. Other children taunted him now for his queer hobby. Did she know that? Yes, his mother knew, she knew, but what could be done?--the boy's father would not lift a finger. Well, of course not, her husband had no backbone. (This was not said so much as it hung in the air: his father's failures commingling with the odor of the child's playthings.) The aunt was scared for his future. Frightened for his soul, too, since the boy didn't even have the decency to quit his unholy labors on the Sabbath. The county insane asylum was only half a day's buggy ride from their hometown of Clarendon, New York. Surely, there, the boy might be cured of his morbid whims.Who knew? Perhaps he'd have more freedom to do as he pleased in an asylum. At the very least, he would have escaped, like his father had tried. Carl resented his mother for what she had done to his father. For the constant nagging. For wanting his father to suffer for his poor choices. For destroying his morale.His mother did not suffer the shame of her husband's cowardice with grace. But still she wasn't going to ship her son off to an asylum. Truth be told, she was fond of the white rabbit Carl had mounted for her birthday. It was perched on a stump in the front yard. His aunt would soon enough change her song, too, after the boy worked his magic on her pet canary--this, after she'd forgotten to put the drape back over its cage one freezing winter night.In any event, he'd been happy to finally move away from home. Lucky to get away.He could still remember the first moment he'd seen the outside of Ward's Natural Science Establishment; it was as if he'd arrived at his true home at last. He'd learned of its existence from his first employer, an interior decorator named David Bruce, who managed to earn quite a tidy living off the current nature craze, painting wildlife murals in the parlors of Brockport, New York's most well-heeled citizens, the sort who spent their leisure time chasing butterflies with silk nets, collecting snails at the beach, or stomping through the woods in high-button shoes in quest of the latest fern de rigueur for their terraria. The obsession with collecting, some might have said, fit the country's growing acquisitiveness. Bruce happened to live just a few miles down the road from Carl's family's farm. Before hiring Carl as his assistant, he had taken him out for an oyster dinner, but as the shells piled up on the older man's plate, he could see the boy was only ravenous for information aboutthe business of stuffing animals and whether it was true a person could make a living doing something so much more edifying than growing potatoes. He could see the boy had an almost feverish air about him, as if he had a true calling. After a few weeks it was clear Carl had no knack for mixing paints or cleaning brushes or sketching starfish or seashells--or anything for that matter that didn't involve a flensing knife. On the other hand, whenever the chance arrived to stuff a bird or chipmunk for one of the cabinets Bruce assembled for his clientele, the youth's display of talent far surpassed that of his employer's. Ultimately, Bruce had had to let him go--the kid was never going to make it as a decorator--but in so doing suggested he might look into getting a position at a place in Rochester called Ward's Natural Science Establishment.That would mean moving away from home. Rochester was twenty miles away from Clarendon. But he was almost eighteen, and at Ward's, he would be working for the country's premier supplier of specimens for the new natural history museums popping up everywhere. For a young aspiring taxidermist, it would be the equivalent of enrolling in the �cole des Beaux-Arts. There, Bruce assured him, he would meet other young men similarly afflicted with his zeal, and he would earn a good dollar doing what he really loved.So there he'd found himself, standing outside the jawbone of a blue whale that served as the front gate to Ward's Natural Science Establishment, trying to screw up the courage to knock on the door. To walk off his nerves, he'd wandered around Rochester, pacing along the busy Erie Canal, and up Buffalo Street where the deafening steam-powered flour mills, whirring and grinding, generated a mist of pulverized flour, which hung in the frigid air like fine snow. (If he had wandered along the canal long enough, he might have taken notice of a skinny young man just a few years older than himself by the name of George Eastman, who was conducting his own dubious experiments with odd-looking glass plates that glistened with a transparent chemical skin.) Finally, Carl ended up back outside the whale's jawbone. It was an all-or-nothing moment. This was the only place where he conceivably belonged. But to think: that he could knock on the door, and this man whom he'd never met, this Professor Ward, could take one look at him and snuff out his young life by simply saying <i>no.</i>For one afternoon in a person's life to have such freight. Everything until now had been mere preparation for this moment.After lingering for what seemed like an eternity on College Avenue, gaining and losing his courage with each passing carriage, he finally built up his nerve to walk under the looming jawbone. Inside the courtyard was like a peddlers' village, or the campus of a New England preparatory school, if stranger. There were fourteen white frame buildings in all, adjoining an orchard. One had a moose skull dangling from the gable. Where you might expect a weather vane on another building was what appeared to be a giant gastropod shell, or maybe a prehistoric snail.

I always called my mother Mrs. Flax. She had driven my little sister Kate and me in the blue Buick station wagon for three days this time, racing from Oklahoma to New England. Skinny Burt LeForest, who had a bulging Adam's apple and was in my high school, tore behind us in a truck full of our furniture, driving wildly to keep up. I had seen Mrs. Flax kiss Burt by the stove a week before, when he came by to change a light bulb we couldn't reach. <br> <br>We arrived in Grove on a round moon night, with lilacs blowing sweet against our new house in the breeze. We rented the place; we always rented. I lay in the back seat, holding Kate, with her curly red hair, on top of me as I stared up at the windshield, which was still covered with Oklahoma dust. Mrs. Flax turned off the motor. I shut my eyes and prayed this would be the town where I heard a voice. Joan of Arc heard voices at thirteen; I had just turned fourteen, but I hadn't given up hope. <br> <br>"But Charlotte," Mrs. Flax said when she found me at age six, kneeling in the middle of the kitchen on a hot Arizona afternoon, "Charlotte, you're Jewish." Mrs. Flax didn't believe in ritual or tradition. "Religion weighs me down," she said. I, however, decided I wanted to repent the first time I saw a girl with ashes on her forehead cross herself and chant Hail Marys before a spelling bee. That was when we lived in Wisconsin; the next day I stole an old piece of charcoal from a neighbor man's barbecue and walked around with a smudge between my eyebrows for a week and a half. <br> <br>I was eight years old when Mrs. Flax was pregnant with Kate. While she drove with her belly pressed up against the steering wheel, I knelt way in the back of the station wagon. I solemnly clipped two curls of my hair and placed them in the Cracker jacks box where I saved my baby teeth. I prayed these relics would be kissed by miles of crusaders, who would wait piously in line someday. <br> <br>I always had trouble trying to be holy, though. First of all, I liked to lie a lot; second of all, I kept falling in love. <br> <br>Mrs. Flax climbed the porch steps in her high heels and polka dot dress. "Girls," she called out into the night, "come give this nice young man a hand." <br> <br>People said Mrs. Flax and I looked alike green eyes, dark curly hair, medium height; not that we ever were the kind to stand giggling back to back. I listened to Burt drag boxes and furniture inside. New England was only a donkey head shape on the map to me. I hadn't come across a Massachusetts saint so far; I didn't know what the odds would be not that I knew anything about odds, but I prayed this would be the place where I'd find divine inspiration. <br> <br>"Wake up, Kate," I said finally. "Welcome to home sweet home number eighteen." <br> <br>Kate woke up yawning, with her hands over her ears. I adored Kate; everybody did. When she was born, I wanted to name her Gobnet, after the virgin beekeeper saint. "I worry, Charlotte, I really do," said Mrs. Flax. <br> <br>Kate hopped up the steps on one foot and I followed her onto the porch. Burt was trying to lift the couch up onto his shoulders and through the front door. I held my breath, trying not to breathe in Mrs. Flax's perfume, as I clutched a leg of the couch; I didn't believe in perfume or make up or anything artificial. I washed with icy water whenever I could stand it; I was going to lead a pure life, free of sin. After Burt yanked the couch up through the doorway, Mrs. Flax followed him inside. <br> <br>I held Kate's hand and stared sleepily out at the dark yard, breathing in the pine air. It seemed as if we'd been on the road forever. I had calculated that I'd wasted far too much of my life in a car. No saints, either male or female, had ever heard the Word at seventy miles an hour on the interstate. I needed to stand very still and as quiet as possible, and then inspiration would pour through my soul. I was losing patience, though. I had tried to be charitable, taking care of Kate all the time and trying not to kill my mother, but lately I was worried I'd succumb to a life of sin. Lots of saints had led secular lives before they turned to the monastic path; I just wasn't sure. I'd read everything to find the answer the Bible, both the Old Testament and the New, and every book I could find on martyrdom. In sixth grade, while a circle of girls sat around reading horse books, I sat alone at my desk, reading about Simone Weil, the Jewish girl who starved her head off trying to become a saint. <br> <br>Suddenly Mrs. Flax gave one of her loud laughs, and a few moments later Burt was back outside. He slapped me on the shoulder, then jumped off the porch and into his truck and drove off down the road. As soon as he left, I took Kate inside. The place smelled of tomato sauce and toy trains. Burt had stuck the couch in the middle of the living room, and there was a jumble of boxes piled in front of the fireplace. Our room was down the hall, with bunk beds set up against the waft. Kate climbed onto the top bunk right away; she liked the top because she said it was like floating on water. I always preferred to be close to the ground. <br> <br>I wandered through the house, avoiding Mrs. Flax, who was sitting on the counter next to the sink, humming "The Star Spangled Banner." I stared at the double bed in her room, trying to figure out if she'd done it with old Burt; she seemed to do it with everyone else. I considered stealing the car right then and running away forever. Within the last year, Mrs. Flax had taught me how to drive. I was underage, but she said being able to drive was the most important skill a woman could have; she taught me one morning in Oklahoma at five A.M., behind the supermarket, as the orange sun came up. I was a slow driver, a very slow driver, driving as if there was something wrong with my mind, according to Mrs. Flax; I put on my signal lights miles before I turned. If there was a church in Grove, I knew I'd be able to drive there if I wanted, but I'd decided long ago that church was not the place for divine inspiration. Saints were called while they were out herding sheep or staggering around the desert or down at the river, getting water in a bucket. Saints were not called while listening to a hot faced man yell at them. I walked down the hall, past .a room with RED SOX carved into the door. The .floor was covered with boxes of Mrs. Flax's personal possessions, which she had decided bored her to tears. <br> <br>When I got back to our room, Kate was curled up like a snail, sound asleep, with her dress, on; but I could never sleep the first night in a place. I never could sleep until I made the room look like it did in every previous house. I opened one of the boxes Burt had dumped in the corner and carefully took out Kate's rock collection. I dusted the rocks twice, then laid them out on a low shelf against the wall. Kate was crazy about those rocks. She picked them up wherever we lived. Now there were a good number stuck to cardboard. Her method was to wrap adhesive tape around each rock, then label it with a made up name. The large rocks were too heavy to glue to cardboard, though. Those she just labeled and lined up in a shoebox, like fat sailors with their white belts. <br> <br>I took out Kate's swimming trophies, which I'd wrapped individually in towels at our last house. I dusted them off and lined them in a row on the window ledge. Then I took out my old Cracker Jacks box, which I'd dragged all over America. I hadn't opened it in six years; I held my breath, then ripped the top and emptied the relics into my hand. As the years passed and we'd moved from state to state, the baby teeth had turned yellow and the curls now lay like dry apostrophes, and still God had not spoken to me. I put them back in the Cracker Jacks box and leaned the box next to Kate's Children's Encyclopedia of Fish of the World on the shelf. <br> <br>Then I took out the tom picture of a pair of grown up brown tie shoes on yellow grass that I was certain belonged to my father. Kate had a different father, but I never told her that, it was one of those lies I just kept telling and telling. I didn't know if it was to protect Kate or because I liked to have secrets, but I always lied. Mrs. Flax never corrected me, either. When I was a kid I liked to refer to my father as Our Father Who Art in Heaven, and when Kate learned to talk baby talk she called him by the same name. I wondered every minute if my father was ever coming back. Saint Barbara became a Christian while her father was away; she became a hermit and lived in a bathhouse. When her father came back he almost killed her for becoming a Christian, but then he was struck by lightning and died with a sizzled smile on his face. My father called Mrs. Flax a few times a year, but he never introduced himself to me. Men called Mrs. Flax every day of her life, and I drove myself nuts trying to figure out which one was Dad. Every few months Mrs. Flax said he'd be visiting soon, but the guy hadn't made an appearance yet. <br> <br>I found a thumbtack on the floor and stuck the picture of his shoes to the closet door. I kissed the picture, then kissed Kate's curls, which smelled faintly of chlorine. Then I lay down on the lower bunk and tried to sleep, but I kept remembering, a pair of hands, which might have been my father's. When I was younger than Kate, in a town in Idaho, a man slid a pair of cardboard glasses on my face, lightly touching my ears, so I could watch an eclipse of the sun without going blind. I stood backward at the window, holding Mrs. Flax's powdery compact mirror, trying to see the sun, but all I could see was my own mouth. And then those hands lightly took the glasses away. <br> <br>I liked the new house and I prayed we wouldn't be leaving right away. I prayed I would stop lying all the time. I prayed my father would return. I prayed I wouldn't fall crazy in love so 0much, and then I prayed that I would. <br> <br>The phone rang early the next morning, and I was the one who stumbled out of bed to the kitche...</p><h2>Taylor&#39;s Guide to Heirloom Vegetables (Taylor&#39;s Weekend Gardening Guides)</h2><p>This Taylor&#39;s Guide sorts out the best heirloom vegetables and tells readers where to find them.

Her name was Christine Granville. That she died young was perhaps unsurprising; that she had survived the Second World War was remarkable.</p><p>The daughter of a feckless Polish aristocrat and his wealthy Jewish wife, Granville would become one of Britain's most daring and highly decorated special agents. Having fled to Britain on the outbreak of war, she was recruited by the intelligence services and took on mission after mission. She skied over the hazardous High Tatras into occupied Poland, served in Egypt and North Africa, and was later parachuted behind enemy lines into France, where an agent's life expectancy was only six weeks. Her courage, quick wit, and determination won her release from arrest more than once, and saved the lives of several fellow officers&#x2015;including one of her many lovers&#x2015;just hours before their execution by the Gestapo. More importantly, the intelligence she gathered in her espionage was a significant contribution to the Allied war effort, and she was awarded the George Medal, the OBE, and the Croix de Guerre.</p><p>Granville exercised a mesmeric power on those who knew her. In <i>The Spy Who Loved</i><i>,</i> acclaimed biographer Clare Mulley tells the extraordinary history of this charismatic, difficult, fearless, and altogether extraordinary woman.</p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, June 2013</strong>: Mere weeks after Germany&#x2019;s 1939 invasion of Poland, a woman the British Secret Services described as a "flaming Polish patriot, expert skier and great adventuress" had made her way back from South Africa to London with a brazen proposal: to ski into Poland from Hungary via the Carpathian Mountains. By the time Hitler's forces fell, Christine Granville had accomplished this and more extraordinary feats, delivering supplies, gathering vital intelligence, and defying expectations. She became Britain's first (and longest serving) female special agent, conducting undercover operations in two occupied countries and missions in numerous theaters of war, rescuing officers minutes before their execution and bringing hundreds of POWs back to the front lines. This story of how a charismatic Jewish Countess and beauty queen--raised to be a sedate society wife--parlayed her crackling vitality, flair for languages, and intrepid determination into action that directly undermined the Nazis makes for a sweepingly cinematic read. Churchill's favorite spy, one of the most decorated female intelligence agents of WWII, and one of her era's most liberated (and desired) women, Granville was driven by a passion for liberty "in love, in politics, and in life in the widest sense." Mulley has a sensitive, elegant, and wry way with Granville's story, informed by deep research into the scant published and complex unpublished material, and coupled with her own new interviews Christine's living friends and their children that vividly humanize her. And while her murder in 1952 at the hands of a jealous lover robbed her of the chance to fully realize her post-war promise, <em>The Spy Who Loved</em> is a marvelous tribute to her life and legacy. <em>--Mari Malcolm</em><p>CLARE MULLEY is the author of <i>The Woman Who Saved the Children</i>: A Biography of Eglantyne Jebb, which won the <i>Daily Mail </i>Biographers' Club Prize.

From dust jacket notes: &#34;Even in his own day, the strange canvases of Hieronymus Bosch attracted wonderment and awe; yet those contemporaries who so admired them at that time were almost wholly blind to the astonishing vision of the future that lay hidden within the paintings. They could only perceive the here-and-now, and the ever-present fear of demons that pervaded those years before the Reformation found ready confirmation in the fantastic inventions of Bosch&#39;s possessed and haunted world. Not many decades later, this was no more than a memory, and from then on Bosch was esteemed as, at most, the ingenious creator of fiendish images and ghostly apparitions. This has all long since changed. Scholars now see what the painter saw, which - while still largely expressed in terms of fable and horror - was always far from being a mere fairy-tale world. What Bosch saw was the fortunes and misfortunes of mankind; and although he concealed his vision within a cipher language that leads from one riddle to another, his message is always fundamentally comprehensible, never ambiguous. Bosch was a realist. His works go far beyond the accustomed limits of the picture: they proclaim the unknown. Bosch sees and paints violence, threats, the terror of machinery. In an age when mechanical technology was in its infancy, his paintings were prophetic in showing how the machine can menace, overpower, and ultimately enslave man himself....Carl Linfert, the distinguished German art critic and author, closely links the scanty known details of the artist&#39;s life to his expert and illuminating analyses of the paintings. He proposes a convincing chronology for all the most important works and explains many of Bosch&#39;s enigmatic images, providing the reader with fascinating insights into the artist&#39;s thought and the key to an understanding of his achievement....&#34;</p><p>Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>A Daughter&#39;s Devotion (George Macdonald Classic Series)</h2><p>With nearly one million books in this series sold, another George MacDonald classic novel retold for today's reader by Michael R.

As a result, Christianity's influence in nineteenth-century England was severely weakened. One hundred years later, John MacArthur, troubled by the seeker-sensitive movement and an emphasis on pragmatism within the church, sounded the same alarm with the first edition of <em>Ashamed of the Gospel</em>.</p><p>In this newly revised and expanded edition, MacArthur gives an overview of developments in the seeker-sensitive movement since his book was first published in 1993. New material traces the line of pragmatic philosophy from the seeker-sensitive movement through the Emergent phenomenon, explaining why the latter is a philosophical heir of the former-and an even greater danger; chronicles the failure of pragmatic approaches to church growth; and emphasizes the importance of evangelicals solidly committed to biblical doctrine rising to positions of leadership.</p></p><p><p><strong>John MacArthur</strong>&nbsp;is the&nbsp;pastor-teacher of Grace Community Church in Sun Valley, California, where he has served since 1969.

Somehow, the only evidence has made its way to the inbox of Chief Medical Examiner Kay Scarpetta, over two thousand miles away in Boston. She has no idea why. But as events unfold with alarming speed, Scarpetta begins to suspect that the paleontologist&#x2019;s disappearance is connected to a series of crimes&nbsp;much closer to home: a gruesome murder, inexplicable tortures, and trace evidence from the last living creatures of the dinosaur age.<br><br>When she turns to those around her, Scarpetta finds that the danger and suspicion have penetrated even her closest circles. Her niece Lucy speaks in riddles. Her lead investigator, Pete Marino, and FBI forensic psychologist and husband, Benton Wesley, have secrets of their own. Feeling alone and betrayed, Scarpetta is tempted by someone from her past as she tracks a killer both cunning and cruel.<br><br>This is Kay Scarpetta as you have never seen her before. <i>The Bone Bed</i>&nbsp;is a must read for any fan of this series, or an ideal starting point for new readers.<p></p></p><p>Patricia Cornwell's most recent bestsellers include Red Mist, Port Mortuary, and Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper&#x2014;Case Closed. Her earlier works include Postmortem&#x2014;the only novel to win five major crime awards in a single year&#x2014;and Cruel and Unusual, which won Britain&#x2019;s prestigious Gold Dagger Award for the best crime<br>novel of 1993. Dr. Kay Scarpetta herself won the 1999 Sherlock Award for the best detective created by an American author.On the same day she receives a mystifying video e-mail about an American anthropologist missing in Canada, Kay Scarpetta retrieves a woman&#x2019;s body from Massachusetts Bay (after disentangling it from a massive sea turtle) and testifies at the trial of a billionaire industrialist accused of murdering his missing wife. Disparate cases tend to connect in crime fiction, and soon Scarpetta&#x2014;with her chief investigator, Pete Marino, temporarily sidelined&#x2014;is searching for what her husband, FBI profiler Benton Wesley, believes to be a serial killer. Unfortunately, one of the cases doesn&#x2019;t quite fit the pattern. And then there&#x2019;s Scarpetta herself, now feeling both her age and some friction in her marriage. She&#x2019;s gazing appreciatively at younger men, including her newly hired deputy at the Cambridge Forensic Center, Dr. Luke Zenner, while Wesley admits that his younger female partner is in love with him and has tried to lure him to bed. Which distracts Scarpetta when the killer, inevitably, targets her. Cornwell&#x2019;s forensics are fine, but she still seems to be struggling to recover the freshness and verve that formerly distinguished the Scarpetta series. Longtime fans may not be bothered, but others may find reading this more a duty than a pleasure. HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: As the twentieth entry in the Kay Scarpetta series, this is bound to be promoted heavily. Shortcomings aside, it extends the personal stories of a handful of characters whom fans have followed for years. --Michele Leber</p><h2>You&#39;ve Got to Read This: Contemporary American Writers Introduce Stories that Held Them in Awe</h2><p>Thirty-four of America&#39;s most distinguished fiction writers--including Oscar Hijuelos, John Irving, and Joyce Carol Oates--introduce the short stories that inspired them most.</p><p><p>Ron Hansen is the bestselling author of the novel <em>Atticus</em> (a finalist for the National Book Award), <em>Hitler's Niece</em>, <em>Mariette in Ecstasy</em>, <em>Desperadoes</em>, and <em>Isn't It Romantic?</em>, as well as a collection of short stories, a collection of essays, and a book for children. <em>The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford</em> was a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award. Ron Hansen lives in northern California, where he teaches at Santa Clara University.</p><p><b>Chapter One</b></p> A Mother's Tale<br>James Agee<br><br>The calf ran up the little hill as fast as he could and stopped sharp. "Mama!" he cried, all out of breath. "What is it! What are they doing! Where are they going!"<br>Other spring calves came galloping too.<br>They all were looking up at her and awaiting her explanation, but she looked out over their excited eyes. As she watched the mysterious and majestic thing they had never seen before, her own eyes became even more than ordinarily still, and during the considerable moment before she answered, she scarcely heard their urgent questioning.<br>Far out along the autumn plain, beneath the sloping light, an immense drove of cattle moved eastward. They went at a walk, not very fast, but faster than they could imaginably enjoy. Those in front were compelled by those behind; those at the rear, with few exceptions, did their best to keep up; those who were locked within the herd could no more help moving than the particles inside a falling rock. Men on horses rode ahead, and alongside, and behind, or spurred their horses intensely back and forth, keeping the pace steady, and the herd in shape; and from man to man a dog sped back and forth incessantly as a shuttle, barking, incessantly, in a hysterical voice. Now and then one of the men shouted fiercely, and this like the shrieking of the dog was tinily audible above a low and awesome sound which seemed to come not from the multitude of hooves but from the center of the world, and above the sporadic bawlings and bellowings of the herd.<br>From the hillside this tumult was so distant that it only made more delicate the prodigious silence in which the earth and sky were held; and, from the hill, the sight was as modest as its sound. The herd was virtually hidden in the dust it raised, and could be known, in general, only by the horns, which pricked this flat sunlit dust like little briars. In one place a twist of the air revealed the trembling fabric of many backs; but it was only along the near edge of the mass that individual animals were discernible, small in a driven frieze, walking fast, stumbling and recovering, tossing their armed heads, or opening their skulls heavenward in one of those cries which reached the hillside long after the jaws were shut.<br>From where she watched, the mother could not be sure whether there were any she recognized. She knew that among them there must be a son of hers; she had not seen him since some previous spring, and she would not be seeing him again. Then the cries of the young ones impinged on her bemusement: "Where are they going?"<br>She looked into their ignorant eyes.<br>"Away," she said.<br>"Where?" they cried. "Where? Where?" her own son cried again.<br>She wondered what to say.<br>"On a long journey."<br>"But where to?" they shouted. "Yes, where to?" her son exclaimed, and she could see that he was losing his patience with her, as he always did when he felt she was evasive.<br>"I'm not sure," she said.<br><br>Their silence was so cold that she was unable to avoid their eyes for long.<br>"Well, not really sure. Because, you see," she said in her most reasonable tone, "I've never seen it with my own eyes, and that's the only way to be sure; isn't it."<br>They just kept looking at her. She could see no way out.<br>"But I've heard about it," she said with shallow cheerfulness, "from those who have seen it, and I don't suppose there's any good reason to doubt them."<br>She looked away over them again, and for all their interest in what she was about to tell them, her eyes so changed that they turned and looked, too.<br>The herd, which had been moving broadside to them, was being turned away, so slowly that like the turning of stars it could not quite be seen from one moment to the next; yet soon it was moving directly away from them, and even during the little while she spoke and they all watched after it, it steadily and very noticeably diminished, and the sounds of it as well.<br><br>"It happens always about this time of year," she said quietly while they watched. "Nearly all the men and horses leave, and go into the North and the West."<br>"Out on the range," her son said, and by his voice she knew what enchantment the idea already held for him.<br>"Yes," she said, "out on the range." And trying, impossibly, to imagine the range, they were touched by the breath of grandeur.<br>"And then before long," she continued, "everyone has been found, and brought into one place; and then . . . what you see, happens. All of them.<br>"Sometimes when the wind is right," she said more quietly, "you can hear them coming long before you can see them. It isn't even like a sound, at first. It's more as if something were moving far under the ground. It makes you uneasy. You wonder, why, what in the world can that be! Then you remember what it is and then you can really hear it. And then, finally, there they all are."<br>She could see this did not interest them at all.<br>"But where are they going?" one asked, a little impatiently.<br>"I'm coming to that," she said; and she let them wait. Then she spoke slowly but casually.<br>"They are on their way to a railroad."<br></p><h2>3rd Edition. Clinical Manual of Oriental Medicine.

In fact, cutting-edge science supports a radically different approach to weight loss and health, proving that by focusing on food and exercise <em>quality</em>&#x2014;rather than calorie <em>quantity&#x2014;</em>you can burn fat and boost health more easily and enjoyably that you ever thought possible.</p><p>The human body does not recognize all calories as equal. Some foods are used to repair tissue, boost brain power, and fuel our metabolism&#x2014;while others are stored as fat. &nbsp; In <em>The Calorie Myth</em>, Bailor shows us how eating <em>more</em> of the right kinds of foods and exercising <em>less</em>, but at a higher intensity, is the true formula for burning fat. </p><p>Why? Because eating high-quality foods&#x2014;like whole plants and nutritious proteins&#x2014;balances the hormones that regulate our metabolism. When we eat these foods, our bodies naturally maintain a healthy weight. But when we eat sugar, starches, processed fats, and other poor quality foods, the body&#x2019;s regulatory system becomes "clogged" and prevents us from burning extra calories. Translation: Those extra 10 pounds aren't the result of eating too much . . . they're the result from eating the wrong foods.</p><p>In <em>The Calorie Myth</em>, Bailor offers clear, comprehensive guidance on what to eat and why, providing an eating plan, recipes, and a simple yet effective exercise regimen based on the principles of high intensity interval training. Losing weight doesn't have to mean going hungry or spending hours at the gym. <em>The Calorie Myth</em>&nbsp;offers a radical new model for weight loss and long-term health. </p></p><p><p>What if everything <em>you thought you knew</em> about weight loss was wrong?</p><p>When it comes to most things in life, we welcome research and progress. From the convenience of our smartphones to the technology in our hospitals, scientific advancement allows us to live better.</p><p>So why are we still following weight-loss advice from the 1950s? Why haven't we ever questioned the "calories in/calories out" model at the foundation of every diet and fitness plan&#x2014;a formula that, not coincidentally, has accompanied record-breaking levels of obesity?</p><p>In <em>The Calorie Myth</em>, Jonathan Bailor exposes the fundamental flaw upon which the diet industry is built and offers a new equation: </p><p>eat More + exercise Less = weight loss</p><p>If calorie math added up, 100 calories of vegetables = 100 calories of candy. That doesn't seem right&#x2014;because it's not. While some calories fuel weight loss, others work against us. In <em>The Calorie Myth</em>, Bailor shows us how eating <em>more</em> of the right kinds of foods and exercising <em>less</em>, but at a higher intensity, is the true formula for burning fat and boosting metabolism.</p><p>Why? Because eating high-quality foods, like whole-food plants, proteins, and fats, balances the hormones that regulate your metabolism. Eating poor-quality foods, like refined starches, sweets, and processed foods, causes a hormonal imbalance, throwing your metabolism off kilter and causing you to store food as fat&#x2014;regardless of how many calories you consume.</p><p>In this revolutionary weight-loss program informed by more than 1,200 scientific studies, Bailor offers clear, comprehensive guidance on what to eat and why, providing an eating plan, recipes, and a simple yet effective exercise regimen.</p><p>Losing weight doesn't have to mean going hungry or spending hours at the gym.

In 1972, the 13-year-old Woodman made a black-and-white photograph of herself sitting at the far end of a sofa in her home in Boulder, Colorado. Her face is obscured by her hair, light radiates from an unseen source behind her out at the viewer through her right hand. This photograph typifies much of what would characterize Woodman's work to come: a semi-obscured female form merging with or flailing against a somewhat bare and often dilapidated interior. In an oeuvre of around 800 photographs made in just nine years, Woodman performed her own body against the textures of wallpaper, door frame, baths and couches, radically extending the Surrealist photography of Man Ray, Hans Bellmer and Claude Cahun and creating a mood and language all her own. In the 30 years since her untimely death, Woodman has gained a following among successive generations of artists and photographers, a testament to her work's undeniable immediacy and enduring appeal Amid a renewed intensification of interest in Francesca Woodman, this volume is published for a major touring exhibition of her photographs and films at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Guggenheim. Containing many previously unpublished photographs, it is the definitive Francesca Woodman monograph.<br><b>Francesca Woodman</b> (1958-1981) was born in Denver, Colorado, to the well-known artists George and Betty Woodman. In 1975 she attended the Rhode Island School of Design, and in 1979 she moved to New York, to attempt to build a career in photography. In 1981, at the age of 22, she committed suicide.</p><p>In an exceptionally informative catalog essay for the present exhibition, the art historian Julia Bryan-Wilson surveys the critical and art historical literature that has proliferated around Woodman's oeuvre.<br>Francesca Woodman, the photographer who took her own life at 22 in 1981, is as close to a true saint as the putatively secular world of contemporary art can claim. The dreamy, formally playful and disarmingly erotic pictures Woodman made - mostly of herself partly unclothed or naked - project a self surrendering unreservedly to the spirit of art...it remains a poignant record of adolescent joy, fear, ambition and angst. It was not only her body that she exposed - she bared her soul too, and that is a rare and beautiful thing. (Ken Johnson <i>The New York Times</i>)<br><br>Even though they are quite small, about 5 by 5 inches, Woodman's haunting photographs have drawn admirers for decades. (Ted Loos <i>The New York Times</i>)<br><br>Franesca Woodman's black and white portraits have a way of getting under your skin. (Hilarie M Sheets <i>W Magazine</i>)<br><br>This is a comprehensive monograph of Francesca Woodman's photographic oeuvre, which as achieved cult status is the 30 years since the artist's brief yet prolific career ended when she took her life at age 22.

It's beautiful, easy to follow, and one-of-a-kind. <br><br>Glass beadmaking has become a crafting phenomenon, and this colorful reference features a rich repertoire of creative ideas. Splashed across the splendid pages in eye-catching photos are all the most popular types of beads, accompanied by the newest, most innovative techniques. The instructions begin with the basics: how to light the torch, wind and cool the bead, and shape the glass into barrels, cones, and discs. As beadmakers' skills develop, they can expand their horizons by experimenting with enamel; using mica dust to form an iridescent sheen; and applying silver, gold, and copper leaf to layers of glass. The most advanced projects are truly remarkable, from floral and sculptural beads to beads that encase images of stars, rainbows, and faces. <i>A Selection of the Crafters Choice Book Club.</i><br></p><p>Kimberley Adams has had her own business selling glass bead jewellery for 15 years. She teaches bead-making workshops at well-respected schools, including John C.

The directions are thought-out, clear, and have corresponding photos for almost every step. The methods learned are applicable to any bead you desire to create, and you will find limitless inspiration from the gallery -- filled with eye-catching and colorful images from the finest glass beading artists. This book is great for those new to beadmaking, but it also contains intermediate and advanced technique sections. After working your way from front to back, you will have mastered (or refreshed your memory in) everything from shaping beads, adding color and decoration, altering surfaces, making gravity and floral beads, fuming, and creating sculptural beads such as a winged heart and a spiral seashell.&#34; -- Belle Armoire Jewelry, Spring 2011 issue &#34;Eye-opening.

A beautiful book.&#34; -- Library Journal</p><h2>Daemonomania</h2><p>For the past two decades, John Crowley has created some of the most beautiful and evocative fiction written anywhere. A recipient of the prestigious American Academy of Arts and Letters Award for Literature, he has written yet another masterpiece that brings together his distinctive blend of magic, mystery, adventure, and wonder.<br><br>When the world ends, it ends somewhat differently for each soul then alive to see it; the end doesn't come all at once but passes and repasses over the world like the shivers that pass over a horse's skin.<br><br>For the people in this novel, the concerns of everyday life -- children and love affairs, work and friendship -- are beginning to transmute into the extraordinary and to reveal the forces, dark and light, that truly govern their lives.<br><br>So it is for Pierce Moffett, would-be historian and author, who has moved from New York to the Faraway Hills, where he seems to discover -- or rediscover -- a path into magic, past and present. And so it is for Rosie Rasmussen, a single mother grappling with her mysterious uncle's legacy and her young daughter Samantha's inexplicable seizures. For Pierce's lover Rose Ryder, whose life is lived half in dream, another path unfolds: she's drawn into a cult that promises to exorcise her demons.<br><br>A great cycle of time is ending, as it did once before, in the bygone days of witchcraft and wars of religion. The lives of Renaissance wizard John Dee and rogue philosopher Giordano Bruno, who was burned at the stake, haunt the present: their stories, true and false, are being reenacted in the peaceful Faraway Hills and may hold the key to the future. <br><br>It is the dark of the year, between Halloween and the winter solstice, and the gateway is open between the worlds of the living and the dead. Pierce and Rosie, Samantha and Rose Ryder, and their enemies and allies -- who have powers hidden until now--must take sides in an age-old war that is approaching the final battle. <br><br>Or is it? In a John Crowley novel, nothing is as it seems. Crowley draws us into a cosmic tug-of-war between familiarity and strangeness, couples us with characters much like ourselves, and then works his own potent magic on the proceedings. <b>Daemonomania</b> is a journey into the very mystery of existence: what is, what went before, and what could break through at any moment in our lives.</p><p>John Crowley's powerfully mysterious <i>D�monomania</i> adds flesh to the world he imagined in <i>�gypt</i> and <i>Love and Sleep</i>. In this book, as in all his books, Crowley transports faithful readers to a place where time, place, and meaning come unstuck. It is in some ways the story of the end of the world as it might be, or might have been, a novel of history, eschatology, and faith with unforgettable characters and hauntingly lovely sentences. If the world's end is neither bang nor whimper but "like the shivers that pass over a horse's skin," how is it perceived by the people living through it?<p> Historian Pierce Moffett finds his key to understanding in New York state's Faraway Hills, as do his lover, Rose Ryder, and single mom Rosie Rasmussen, whose daughter seems to suffer from d�monomania--spiritual possession by Renaissance magician John Dee. Each character must pick a careful path between the colliding juggernauts of past and present, magic and mundane. The wind of apocalypse is blowing:</p><p> </p><blockquote>"Scary wind....

He in fact knew what one, for it was from him that she had heard mythologies of wind, how it bloweth where it listeth, one part of Nature not under God's thumb and therefore perhaps at the disposal of our Enemy; she had heard his stories about changer winds, how one had once blown away the Spanish Armada and thus saved England from Catholic conquest, a famous wind which if you went to look for it in the records of the time wasn't there. </p></blockquote> In typical Crowley style, magic is seamlessly woven into the narrative. Pierce is writing the story of the end of the world while it happens, Rose joins a cult that promises salvation, and Rosie inherits a spooky legacy that might hold the secret to saving her daughter. All are involved in deep exchanges of power, and all must yield to what Crowley calls the "queasy pressure of Fate."<p> Crowley describes <i>D�monomania</i> best when he writes about Pierce's book: "The book... was about magic, secret histories, and the End of the World, an event that Pierce would suggest was under way undetectably even as he wrote, as the reader read." This is a complex, disturbing, and beautiful book, one that will bear rereading. Crowley's writing is gorgeous in places, frustrating in others, but always irresistible. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p>"Brilliant ... a talented writer."<br>--<i> The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"Haunting ... gripping ... astonishing."<br>-- <i>The Washington Post Book World</i><br><br>"An extraordinary novel ... a prophecy of America entering the authentic new age: magical, potentially destructive, and utterly uncanny ... a masterpiece of spiritual insight and of superb style and characterization."<br>-- Harold Bloom<br><br>"[Crowley] transforms the lead of daily life into seriously dazzling artistic gold."<br>-- <i>Newsday</i></p><h2>Sacred Sage: How It Heals</h2><p>Learn about the ceremonial uses of sage and how sage can help with physical, mental, and spiritual healing.

Priests, nuns, tradesmen, men from the city--all pilgrims on the road to Canterbury. To pass the long journey they told each other stories of magic and trickery, of animals with blazing eyes, of people with pants on fire, of love and death and the devil. Geraldine McCaughrean retells <em>The Canterbury Tales</em> for children in a lively and humorous style that captures the original flair of Chaucer himself. She introduces us to the characters who told these tales: the shy, battle-hardened Knight, the Summoner whose breath smells of onions, the Widow of Bath who likes a happy ending.

In <i>The Prayer of the Lord</i>, Dr. R.C. Sproul writes, &#x201c;Jesus&#x2019; intent was to give His disciples a model prayer, an example to follow, one that would teach them transferrable principles for conversation with God.&#x201d; In short, Christ gave the Lord&#x2019;s Prayer to teach His disciples about prayer, and Dr. Sproul, in his trademark fashion, brings out many of the truths Christ intended for His followers to learn.</p></p><p><p>Dr. R.C. Sproul (1939&#x2013;2017) was founder of Ligonier Ministries, an international Christian discipleship organization located near Orlando, Fla. He was also founding pastor of Saint Andrew&#x2019;s Chapel in Sanford, Fla., first president of Reformation Bible College, and executive editor of <i>Tabletalk</i> magazine. His radio program, <i>Renewing Your Mind</i>, is still broadcast daily on hundreds of radio stations around the world and can also be heard online. Dr. Sproul contributed dozens of articles to national evangelical publications, spoke at conferences, churches, colleges, and seminaries around the world, and wrote more than one hundred books, including <i>The Holiness of God</i>, <i>Chosen by God</i>, and <i>Everyone&#x2019;s a Theologian</i>. He also served as general editor of the <i>Reformation Study Bible</i>.</p><p>R.C. Sproul has an amazing gift for explaining difficult truths in pithy, memorable, and easy-to-grasp ways. He is the ideal teacher for a study of the Lord's Prayer, because the prayer itself is a profound lesson on a difficult subject, given by Jesus to His disciples in an amazing economy of words. You will be greatly blessed and edified by this book.</p> --Dr. John MacArthur: Pastor, Grace Community Church; President, The Masters College and Seminary Sun Valley, California<br><br><p>Here is a very special book on prayer. It will not leave you over-whelmed with failure and crushed into giving prayer yet another try -as many books and sermons on prayer do. Instead, it will lead you gently by the hand- as Jesus did when He taught the disciples the prayer on which these pages are based. It will draw you into a sense of the privilege of prayer, stimulate new desires to pray, even leave you with a sense of the delights of prayer. These pages have an atmosphere of light and are permeated by a sense of freshness and joy. Happy indeed is the theologian who can stimulate prayer. And happy are we that R.C. Sproul has become such a theologian. The Prayer of the Lord is-quite simply-a spiritual treat.</p> --Dr. Sinclair B.

No player before him possessed his mixture of speed and power, which allowed him to become the first man in history to belt more than forty home runs and swipe more than forty bases in the same season. He won Rookie of the Year, Most Valuable Player, and a World Series ring. </p><p>Canseco shattered the mold of the out-of-shape baseball player and ushered in a new era of superathletes who looked like bodybuilders, made outrageous salaries, and enjoyed rock-star lifestyles. And the ticket for this ride? Steroids. Behind the gaudy stats and the glamour of his public life, Canseco cultivated a secret just about everyone in MLB knew about, one that would alter the game of baseball and the way we view our heroes forever. Canseco made himself a guinea pig of the performance-enhancing drugs that were only just beginning to infiltrate the American underground. Anabolic steroids, human growth hormones -- Canseco mixed, matched, and experimented to such a degree that he became known throughout the league as "The Chemist." He passed his knowledge on to trainers and fellow players, and before long, performance-enhancing drugs were running rampant throughout Major League Baseball. Sluggers scooping up pitches at their ankles and blasting them out of the park, pitchers cranking fastballs inning after inning -- Canseco showed the players how to customize their doses to sculpt the bodies they wanted, and baseball as we know it was the result. </p><p>Today, this issue has crept out of the closet and burst into the headlines as players balloon to herculean proportions and hundred-year-old records are not only broken, but also demolished. In this shocking memoir, Canseco sheds light on a life of dizzying highs and debilitating lows, provides the answers to questions about steroids that millions of fans are only now beginning to ask -- and suggests that, far from being a passing trend, the steroid revolution is only a taste of things to come. </p><p>Who's juiced? According to Canseco's authoritative account, more than you think. And baseball will never be the same. </p></p><p>Touted as a <i>Ball Four</i> for the new millennium, Jose Canseco's <i>Juiced</i> promises to expose not only the rampant use of performance-enhancing substances in baseball (with steroids replacing the amphetamines of Bouton's day), but the painfully human flaws of its heroes as well. A steroid devotee since the age of 20, Canseco goes beyond admitting his own usage to claim that with the tacit approval of the league's powers-that-be he acted as baseball's ambassador of steroids and is therefore indirectly responsible for "saving" the game.<p> Chief among his claims is that he introduced Mark McGwire to steroids in 1988 and that he often injected McGwire while they were teammates. According to Canseco, steroids and human growth hormones gave McGwire and Sammy Sosa (whose own usage was "so obvious, it was a joke") the strength, stamina, regenerative ability, and confidence they needed for a record-setting home run duel often credited with restoring baseball's popularity after the 1994 strike. Although he devotes a lot of ink to McGwire, Canseco envisions himself as a kind of Johnny Steroidseed, spreading the gospel of performance enhancement, naming a number of players that he either personally introduced to steroids or is relatively certain he can identify as fellow users. Because Canseco plays fast and loose with some of the facts of his own career he provides fodder for those looking to damage his credibility, but in many ways questions of public and personal perception are what raise the book beyond mere vitriolic tell-all. Those willing to heed his request and truly listen to what he has to say will find <i>Juiced</i> to be an occasionally insightful meditation on the workings of public perception and a consistently interesting character study. <i>--Shane Farmer</i></p><p>Jose Canseco was born in Havana, Cuba, and immigrated to Miami in the 1970s. After being drafted by the Oakland Athletics, he went on to win Rookie of the Year, the American League MVP Award, and a World Series ring. In all, he played for seven different teams and ended his baseball career with a total of 462 home runs. Today, Canseco lives a quiet life in California with his daughter, Josie.</p></p><h2>Usborne Books 1000 Things that Go</h2><p>Usborne Book 1000 Things That Go - Hardback&nbsp;A Beginners Book of Animal Word/Picture Identification&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong><p>This thrilling word and picture book probably contains every type of vehicle you've ever seen - and lots that you haven't.

The story focuses on the family inside the Ipatiev House, capturing the oppressive atmosphere and the dynamics of a group&#x2014;the Romanovs, their servants, and guards&#x2014;thrown together by extraordinary events. </p><p>Marshaling overlooked evidence from key witnesses such as the British consul to Ekaterinburg, Sir Thomas Preston, American and British travelers in Siberia, and the now-forgotten American journalist Herman Bernstein, Helen Rappaport gives a brilliant account of the political forces swirling through the remote Urals town. She conveys the tension of the watching world: the Kaiser of Germany and George V, King of England&#x2014;both, like Alexandra, grandchildren of Queen Victoria&#x2014;their nations locked in combat as the First World War drew to its bitter end. And she draws on recent releases from the Russian archives to challenge the view that the deaths were a unilateral act by a maverick group of the Ekaterinburg Bolsheviks, identifying a chain of command that stretches directly, she believes, to Moscow&#x2014;and to Lenin himself.</p><p>Telling the story in a compellingly new and dramatic way, <i>The Last Days of the Romanovs</i> brings those final tragic days vividly alive against the backdrop of Russia in turmoil, on the brink of a devastating civil war.</p></p><p><p>Helen Rappaport studied Russian at Leeds University and is a specialist in Russian and nineteenth-century women&#x2019;s history.

Drawing on new archives and forensics, she crafts a portrait of the final weeks of Russia's last imperial family, cramped in the House of Special Purpose in Ekaterinburg. Though Tsar Nicholas's rule was harsh, the love and religious devotion he and his family shared makes them sympathetic. The Romanovs are now saints in Russian Orthodoxy, symbols of faith and hope.

When Gillian hears her biological clock ticking, she puts herself in the hands of the world-famous Waters Clinic and is artificially inseminated (as described in a somewhat plodding first chapter that omits no detail of the procedure). The action picks up when Gillian switches places with her twin, a media escort, and chauffeurs sexy astronaut Chief Hart around town. It turns out to be a fatal attraction, and suspicion falls on Chief when Gillian's mutilated body is found the next day. <p> The dead woman's smarmy and enigmatic boyfriend, Jem Hennings, has a vested interest in focusing police efforts on Hart, but Melina has her own reasons for thinking him wrong. Jem's connection with a charismatic preacher known as Brother Gabriel is at the heart of this mildly creepy mystery, in which the plucky Melina tracks Brother Gabriel to his lair and uncovers his diabolical plot while simultaneously revealing her own dark secret. The ending is telegraphed well in advance, but that won't deter Brown's many fans from relishing the details, including some sex scenes that are spicier than most of the florid prose that usually turns up in romantic thrillers of this sort.

Karl Wittgenstein, who ran away from home as a wayward and rebellious youth, returned to his native Vienna to make a fortune in the iron and steel industries. He bought factories and paintings and palaces, but the domineering and overbearing influence he exerted over his eight children resulted in a generation of siblings fraught by inner antagonisms and nervous tension. Three of his sons committed suicide; Paul, the fourth, became a world-famous concert pianist, using only his left hand and playing compositions commissioned from Ravel and Prokofiev; while Ludwig, the youngest, is now regarded as one of the greatest philosophers of the twentieth century. In this dramatic historical and psychological epic, Alexander Waugh traces the triumphs and vicissitudes of a family held together by a fanatical love of music yet torn apart by money, madness, conflicts of loyalty, and the cataclysmic upheaval of two world wars. Through the bleak despair of a Siberian prison camp and the terror of a Gestapo interrogation room, one courageous and unlikely hero emerges from the rubble of the house of Wittgenstein in the figure of Paul, an extraordinary testament to the indomitable spirit of human survival. <br><br>Alexander Waugh tells this saga of baroque family unhappiness and perseverance against incredible odds with a novelistic richness to rival Thomas Mann&#x2019;s <i>Buddenbrooks</i>.</p></p><p><p>ALEXANDER WAUGH is the grandson of Evelyn Waugh and the son of columnist Auberon Waugh. He has written several books, including <i>Classical Music: A New Way of Listening</i>, <i>Time</i>,<i> </i>and <i>God</i>.<i> </i>He lives in Somerset, England, with his wife and three children.</p>1&nbsp;&nbsp; VIENNESE DEBUT<br>Vienna is described--_over-described--as a city of paradox; but for those who do not know this or have never been there, it may be pictured as a capriccio drawn from the flat sound bites of the Austrian Tourist Board, a place defined by its rich cream cakes, Mozart mugs and T-shirts, New Year's waltzes, grand, bestatued buildings, wide streets, old fur-coated women, electric trams, and Lipizzaner stallions. The Vienna of the early twentieth century was not marketed in this way. In those days it was not marketed at all. Maria Hornor Lansdale's once-indispensable guide of 1902 draws a portrait of the Hapsburg capital that is at once grubbier and more dynamic than anything suggested in our modern guidebooks. Her book describes parts of the Innere Stadt or city center as "dark, dirty and gloomy" and of the Jewish quarter she wrote: "The interiors of the houses are unspeakably squalid. As one ascends the stair the rickety banister sticks to one's fingers, and the walls on either side ooze. Entering a small dark room the ceiling is covered with soot and the furniture crowded close together."<br>A German might step onto a Viennese streetcar and find himself unable to exchange a word with any of his fellow passengers, for the city then was home to a rapidly expanding population of Magyars, Rumanians, Italians, Poles, Serbs, Czechs, Slovenes, Slovaks, Croats, Ruthenians, Dalmatians, Istrians and Bosnians, all of whom lived together apparently in happiness. An American diplomat describing the city in 1898 wrote:<br>A man who had been but a short time in Vienna, may himself be of pure German stock, but his wife will be Galician or Polish, his cook Bohemian, his children's nurse Dalmatian, his man a Servian, his coachman a Slav, his barber a Magyar, and his son's tutor a Frenchman. A majority of the administration's employees are Zechs, and the Hungarians have most influence in the affairs of the government. No, Vienna is not a German city!<br>The Viennese were regarded abroad as a good-natured, easygoing, and highly cultured people. By day the middle class congregated in cafes, spending hours in conversation over a single cup of coffee and a glass of water. Here newspapers and magazines were provided in all languages. In the evenings they dressed for dancing, for the opera, the theater or the concert hall. They were fanatical about these entertainments, unforgiving of the poor player who forgot his lines or the singer who sang sharp, while idolizing or deifying their favorites. The Viennese writer Stefan Zweig remembered that passion from his youth: "Whereas in politics, in administration, or in morals, everything went on rather comfortably and one was affably tolerant of all that was slovenly and overlooked many an infringement, in artistic matters there was no pardon; here the honour of the city was at stake."<br><br>***<br><br>On december 1, 1913, there was cold sunshine over most of Austria. By the evening a mist had spread from the northern slopes of the Carpathian Mountains down to the rolling hills and verdant lowlands of the Alpine Foreland. In Vienna, the air was still, the streets and pavements quiet and the temperature uncommonly cold. For the twenty-six-year-old Paul Wittgenstein this was a day of high excitement and excruciating tension.<br>Clammy fingers and cold hands figure in every pianist's worst dream--the slightest sheen from the glands of the pads can cause the fingers to slip or "glitch," accidentally hitting two adjacent keys at once. The sweaty-fingered pianist is slave to his caution. If his hands are too cold, the finger muscles will stiffen. Coldness in the bones does not drive sweat from the skin and in the worst instances the fingers may be immobilized by cold while remaining slippery with sweat. Many concert artists spend a nervous hour or two before a winter recital with their hands plunged into a basin of hot water.<br>Paul's concert debut was scheduled to start at 7:30 p.m. in the Grosser Musikvereinsaal, a hallowed place, of near perfect acoustic, where Brahms, Bruckner and Mahler heard many of their works performed for the first time. It is from here--the "Golden Hall"--that the famous New Year orgy of waltzes and polkas is annually broadcast to the world. Paul did not expect his debut to sell out. The auditorium had a seating capacity of 1,654, with 300 standing places. It was a Monday night, he was unknown, and the program he had chosen to perform was unfamiliar to the Viennese public. He was, however, well acquainted with techniques for papering a house. As a boy he had been sent by his mother to buy 200 tickets for a concert in which a family friend was playing the violin. The man at the ticket office dismissed him as a tout, shouting in his face: "If it's tickets for resale you're wanting you can go elsewhere!" Paul returned to his mother, begging her to appoint someone else to the task. For the first time in his life he felt ashamed of being rich.<br>If the hall was going to be half empty, at least those seats that were occupied should be filled with as many allies as possible. He wanted to create an atmosphere that would give the impression of strong public support. The Wittgenstein family was large and well connected. All siblings, cousins, uncles and aunts were expected to attend and to applaud uproariously at the end of each piece regardless of how they felt he had played. Tenants, servants and the servants' distant relations, many of whom had never before attended a concert of serious music, were plied with tickets and summoned to appear. Paul could have hired a smaller hall but was advised that the critics might not show up if he did so. He needed Max Kalbeck of the Neues Wiener Tagblatt and Julius Korngold of the Neue Freie Presse to be there. These were the two most influential music critics in Vienna.<br>Every detail was carefully considered. A concert with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra would have cost him nearly twice as much as the less prestigious Tonkunstler Orchestra, but money was no object. "Quite apart from the price," he later wrote, "I would not hire the Vienna Philharmonic. Probably they won't play as you want them to do, it will look like a horse which you can't ride; and then if the concert is a success, people might say it was only due to the orchestra's merit." He chose the Tonkunstler.<br>The conductor, Oskar Nedbal, was twelve years older than Paul, an ex-pupil of Dvorak, a composer and a first-class violist who had joined the Tonkunstler Orchestra in 1906 after ten years as conductor of the Czech Philharmonic. On Christmas Eve 1930, he threw himself head first from a fourth-story window of a hotel in Zagreb and was heard of no more.<br>Paul's program was unusual, obstinate and provocative. He wanted to present four consecutive works for piano and orchestra--four virtuosic concertos in a single evening. Irrespective of success or failure, this young man's debut would long be remembered as an audacious gymnastic spectacle. Works by the inebriate Irish composer John Field, who had died in Moscow of cancer of the rectum in 1837, had long fallen from fashion in Vienna. Nowadays "Drunken John" is best remembered as the man who invented the nocturne--a form of short piano reverie later popularized by Chopin. Paul's valet and cook were probably not the only ones in the audience that night never to have heard of him. Even among the musical cognoscenti of 1913, few would have rated Field as worthy of the Golden Hall, for Vienna had a musical heritage of its own, the most illustrious of any city in the world, and to those raised on a diet of Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Schubert, Brahms, Bruckner and Mahler (all of whom had lived at one time or another within the city walls), Field's music would have seemed at best an insipid curiosity, at worst a bad-taste joke.<br>History does not record how Paul felt in the hours leading up to the concert or his state of mind as he dressed in his tails, warmed his hands in the green room, climbed the steep steps onto the concert platform and took his bows before an audience of friends, strangers, critics, mentors, teachers and servants, but he never succeeded in controlling his nerves. Later he was observed to bash the walls with his fists, tear up his music or hurl furniture across the room in the fraught final minutes before walking onto the stage.<br>The Field Concerto is in three movements lasting a total of thirty-five minutes. If Paul failed to notice at the time, he must have been informed afterward that Julius Korngold, chief critic of the Neue Freie Presse, had left the auditorium during the applause and had not returned to hear his renditions of Mendelssohn's Serenade and Allegro giocoso, the Variations and Fugue on a Theme of Czerny by Josef Labor, or Liszt's crashing bravura Concerto in E flat. As he and his family scoured the papers and music journals in the days following the concert, this critic's curious behavior must have weighed heavily on their minds.<br>Ludwig, Paul's younger brother, was not in Vienna to hear him play. Three months earlier he had moved from England (where he had been studying philosophy at Cambridge) into two rooms of a postmaster's house in a tiny village at the bottom of a fjord, north of Bergen in Norway. According to the diaries of his closest friend, his decision to exile himself was "wild and sudden." In September he had stated that he wished to withdraw from a world in which "he perpetually finds himself feeling contempt for others and irritating others by his nervous temperament." He was also at this time suffering (as he often did) from delusions of his own death. "The feeling that I shall have to die before being able to publish my ideas is growing stronger and stronger in me every day," he wrote to his tutor and mentor at Cambridge. A fortnight later a shock spurred him on his course of action--it took the form of a letter announcing that his sister Gretl and her husband Jerome were coming to live in London.

He introduces a colorful cast of characters, including the CIA operative from Texas who married a Thai and became an officer in the Thai police and the Hmong officer who led his people in a long and costly struggle against the Communists only to find himself resettled in Montana after the war. Warner writes of a nation that became a pawn of the great powers, a piece that could be sacrificed to draw Communist pressure off South Vietnam and act as a shield for Thailand. Early American involvement in Laos, directed toward nation-building and military advice, was replaced by an effort to Americanize the war in a way unsuited to the circumstances and doomed to failure. Given that literature on Laos is so scant, and with Warner's excellent perspective, this work is highly recommended for academic and public libraries.<br><i>Robert Andrews, Duluth P.L., Minn.</i><br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Between 1960 and 1973, the U.S. waged war in Laos under the auspices of the CIA. Undeclared and unreported, it cost thousands of lives and contributed to the climate of deception that poisoned U.S. policy in Southeast Asia. Journalist Warner (Haing Ngor: A Cambodian Odyssey) relies heavily on interviews with former CIA operatives and other American participants to reconstruct an operation characterized by idealism on the ground and by cynicism and misunderstanding at higher levels. Significant early successes against the Pathet Lao and their North Vietnamese allies were wasted, according to Warner, as the U.S. sacrificed its clients for the sake of the expanding war in Vietnam. Once that conflict ended, the Laotians were left to their fate?an abandonment in cold blood that Warner considers an indelible stain on this country's reputation. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Fears of Henry IV: The Life of England&#39;s Self-Made King</h2><p>An author with a strong track record now tackles the turbulent reign of Henry IV, the first Lancastrian king.<br><br>By 1405, King Henry IV had already survived at least eight plots to dethrone or kill him in the first six years of his reign. Henry had not always been so unpopular. The son of John of Gaunt, he was courteous, confident, well-educated, musical and spiritually fervent. In 1399, at the age of thirty-two, he was enthusiastically greeted as the saviour of the realm when he ousted from power the insecure and tyrannical King Richard II.<br><br>Therein lay Henry&#x2019;s weakness. By making himself King he had broken God&#x2019;s law and left himself starkly open to criticism. Enemies everywhere tried to take advantage of his questionable right to the crown. Such overwhelming threats transformed him from a hero into a duplicitous murderer: a king prepared to go to any lengths to save his family and his throne.<br><br>But against all the odds, what Henry achieved was to take a poorly ruled nation, establish a new Lancastrian dynasty, and introduce the principle that a king must act in accordance with Parliament. He might not have been the most glorious king England ever had, but he was one of the bravest, and certainly the greatest survivor of them all.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>Ian Mortimer is the author of two other medieval biographies: <b>The Greatest Traitor: The Life of Sir Roger Mortimer </b>and <b>The Perfect King: The Life of Edward III</b>.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>&#34;[Mortimer] has an instinctive sympathy for the men about whom he writes, a real understanding of the mentalities of late medieval England, and a vivid historical imagination which lends colour and excitement to his pages&#34; * Literary Review * &#34;Mortimer&#39;s book is a success and tells an important story very well&#34; -- Richard Francis * Daily Telegraph * &#34;An arresting and original biography&#34; -- Jessie Childs * Sunday Telegraph * &#34;[It] possesses the rare combination of clarity, liveliness, balanced judgement, erudition without pedantry, and scholarship founded on his own research among primary sources&#34; * Scotland on Sunday * &#34;The book is at its most compelling in conjuring a sense of place or occasion&#34; * Guardian *</p><h2>John Train&#39;s Most Remarkable Occurrences</h2><p>Over the years, Train&#39;s remarkable books have gathered a dedicated following for their hilarious deadpan humor and their stylish literary grace.

The iconography of piracy--peg legs, eye patches, pieces of eight, squawking parrots, the Jolly Roger--was first codified in <i>A General History of the Robberies and Murders of the Most Notorious Pirates</i>. This collection of brief biographies reads like a <i>Who's Who?</i> of piracy, with entries on Captains Kidd, Rackam, and Roberts, women-in-disguise pirates Anne Bonny and Mary Read, and the infamous Edward Teach, a.k.a. Blackbeard, "that couragious Brute, who might have pass'd in the World for a Heroe, had he been employ'd in a good Cause."<p> First published in 1724, <i>A General History</i> is the book that launched a thousand pirate stories--inspiring Robert Louis Stevenson's Long John Silver, J.M. Barrie's Captain Hook, and Rafael Sabatini's Captain Blood. Though it had been attributed to a shadowy character named Captain Charles Johnson since its date of publication, the book has now been convincingly (though not incontrovertibly) attributed to Daniel Defoe. The 18th-century text, reproduced here complete with the awkward sentence construction, capitalization of nouns proper and common, and frequent italicizing typical of its era, sometimes makes for rather difficult reading, but Defoe's prose still manages to sparkle. With a new introduction by Richard West, author of <i>Daniel Defoe: The Life and Strange, Surprising Adventures</i>, <i>A General History</i> is a must-read for armchair swashbucklers. <i>--C.B. Delaney</i></p>Originally published in 1724, this famous account of the lives and exploits of the most notorious pirates of the day was an immediate success. Written by the mysterious Captain Johnson (who was for some years thought to be Robinson Crusoe author Daniel Defoe), it appeared in the book world at a time now described as "The Golden Age of Piracy."With his dramatic writing style, which vividly captures the realities of their savage existence, the author documents specific events, including trials, of a number of the most feared pirates. Highly detailed, these accounts ensure the pirates were accurately depicted in all their gruesome glory. Indeed, the work has become the main source for scholars hoping to learn more about the female pirates Mary Read and Anne Bonny (both of whom escaped execution by being pregnant), and was largely responsible for the posthumous fame of Blackbeard and Captain Kidd.From Long John Silver to Captain Hook, pirates have been figures of horror and fascination for centuries. That these literary creations grew from factual evidence, much of it from this book, only serves to fire the imagination and keep their stories alive. In the ensuing 270 years since its first publication, A General History of the Pirates has come to be generally regarded as the classic study of one of the most popular subjects in maritime history.

We travel with Linda Johnsen for a fascinating investigation of the great women saints of India who manifest the divine in their lives. Together with her we comb the scriptures, meet the holy ones, and are led, step by step, to sit in awe at the feet of six remarkable, contemporary women.</p><p>Linda Johnsen is a longtime student of religious philosophy and spirituality. She holds an M.S. degree in Eastern and Western Psychology and has postgraduate training in theology and scripture study. Linda is a well-known writer and lives in California.In The Hindu tradition, God has both male and female characteristics. This fine investigation presents six contemporary women saints of India who are considered to be the exemplification of the feminine aspect of the divine, living incarnations of the Divine Mother or the Goddess. Johnsen, a longtime student of religion and spirituality, not only interviewed these women but also lived and walked among them in the United States and India. The result of her studies is and engrossing and charming book that illustrate the great strength of character and spiritual wisdom these women possess. A list is provided so that one can get in touch with their centers in this country. Useful to informed lay readers and scholars generally, this book is highly recommended for religion collections in both public and academic libraries. --Marilyn E. Schafer, writing for Library Journal, June 1, 1994<br><br>With her book Daughters of the Goddess, Linda Johnsen valiantly gives us a shot of enthusiasm, providing an impetus to pursue spiritual treasures. Following Johnsen to India, we get to sit in Hindu homes, listen to tales of women saints immortalized by oral tradition, and wonder what it would have been like growing up aspiring to become divine beings rather than movie stars. What if a wise old woman had taught us not only about mastering a profession or a social role but about mastering ourselves? asks Johnsen. What if we had grown up knowing we were daughters and sons of the Goddess? Backpacking through India, Johnsen introduces us to six women saints, five of which Johnsen personally interviewed. Together with Johnsen, we receive spiritual gems from women mystics who are still quite accessible with the exception of Anandamayi Ma, who passed away in 1982. --Elizabeth U. Harding, writing for Yoga Journal, January/February 1995</p><h2>Testimony of Light: An extraordinary message of life after death</h2><p>This moving story, based on the communications Helen Greaves received telepathically from her deceased friend, is an inspiring testament to the enduring power of their friendship.</p><p>Charles William Daniel (1871-1955) was a maverick free-thinker whose tiny publishing house had august links with many of the most influential thinkers and movements of the 20th century. To wit, copies of Daniel&#39;s books could be found in the library at Ghandi&#39;s ashram. This spirit lived on after his death, and the company maintained its niche by publishing definitive texts on a variety of spiritual and esoteric subjects. Many of these titles, notably those on Aromatherapy and Bach Flower remedies, have become standard works on the subject. When the C.W. Daniel list went looking for a new home, the Vermilion and Rider imprints were the natural place for this wonderful collection of authors.Helen Greaves was an experienced writer, a talented medium and a keen student in the higher studies of mysticism.</p><h2>Ken Price: Slow and Steady Wins the Race: Works on Paper 1962-2010 (Drawing Papers)</h2><p>This publication accompanies the first survey of drawings by Los Angeles artist Ken Price (1935&#x2013;2013), best known for his abstract, brightly colored ceramic sculptures. Price&#x2019;s work was only widely exhibited later in his life, but scholars have long admired his highly original forms. As early as 1966, Lucy Lippard commented: &#x201c;No one else on the East or West Coast is working like Kenneth Price.&#x201d; Like his better-known sculptures, these drawings feature an idiosyncratic array of amorphous shapes. The book includes an in-depth 44-page illustrated essay by exhibition curator Douglas Dreishpoon, a 20-page section detailing a rarely seen large-scale scroll drawing from 1962, and color plates of all of the nearly 70 works in the exhibition, tracking the evolution of Price&#x2019;s drawings over 48 years and demonstrating a wide range of characters and techniques.</p><p></p><h2>Swine Lake</h2><p><p>When a lean and mangy wolf stumbles into the Boarshoi Ballet, he finds tasty pigs a-plenty, twirling and whirling in a performance of <em>Swine Lake</em>. Faced with all those luscious porkers, whats a hungry wolf to do? Well, something totally surprising, as it turns out.</p><p>Pure fun from Marshall and Sendak--an incomparable duo! </p></p><p>Wolves and pigs have always been excellent fodder for suspenseful children's stories, and <i>Swine Lake</i> proves it once again, this time in the masterful hands of the late James Marshall and Maurice Sendak. Marshall wrote the book fully intending to illustrate it himself, but when he died in 1992, his good friend Sendak was charged with the challenging task of bringing this delightful work to life. And come to life it does! The rollicking tale opens with a mangy, hungry wolf on the prowl in an unfamiliar part of town. Soon the wolf's nose twitches uncontrollably. He smells pigs! Just across the street is a theater marquee bearing the words <i>Swine Lake. Boarshoi Ballet.</i> The wolf can scarcely conceal his delight, and "soon the aroma of pig, thinly disguised by French perfume, was making him swoon." <p> Snatching matinee tickets from a swanky ticket-scalping sow who arrives in a limousine, he enters the theater. "Had the ticket taker been more observant, he would have noticed the long claws and much that follows could have been avoided," Marshall adds parenthetically. The wolf is escorted by a distracted usher to his box seat, just a short pounce from the stage. When the show begins, the wolf ponders which might be the juiciest pig. But as he assesses the probable quality of the pork, he begins to get lost in the magical story, and decides to put off his attack until act 2... and in fact forgets to make his move altogether. That very night he breaks into his piggy bank and spends his last penny on a ticket for the evening performance of <i>Swine Lake</i>. </p><p> Anyone who is familiar with <i>Swan Lake</i> will be positively giddy to behold Marshall and Sendak's porcine take on this well-known ballet, but certainly no cultural context is necessary to appreciate the simple plot. With a winning story about the power of the theater to soothe the hungriest, toothiest of beasts, this fabulous team has made an absolutely historic contribution to children's literature. Fans will see a lighter, funnier side to Sendak than they've seen before, as Marshall's comic spirit gently guides his paintbrush and pens. (Click to see a sample spread.

In <i>Anne of the Thousand Days</i> (1969), Valerie Gearon plays her as the dark-haired, &#x2018;pliant eldest daughter&#x2019; of Thomas Boleyn. Henry VIII&#x2019;s affair with her is dated to 1523; Anne Boleyn complains: &#x2018;We have had the King in the bosom of this family for three years!&#x2019; When next we see Mary, she has been banished to Hever and is pregnant with Henry&#x2019;s child. Sir Thomas tells her she must make no trouble about being abandoned, to avoid putting her family at risk. <p></p> Mary warns her sister: &#x2018;Learn from me, Nan. Lock up your heart.&#x2019; She has clearly lost her own heart: when the King visits, she sits weeping alone. It is inevitable that film makers make dramatic capital from the scenario of one sister snaring the King who has abandoned the other. <p></p> Watching the film today, one is struck by its integrity and the efforts made to achieve a degree of accuracy, which are markedly absent from some modern historical films. <p></p> Clare Cameron made a cameo appearance as Mary in <i>Henry VIII</i> (2003). When the King (Ray Winstone) descends on Hever to court Anne, Mary is big with a child he doubts is his--and faints at the sight of him. This is one of many gratuitous scenes in the series. The pregnant Mary is about to be married to &#x2018;a provincial book-keeper&#x2019;. Later, bending the historical chronology, Henry says he will grant Mary lands, a title and a good marriage; and he titles her father Earl of Essex (his title was in fact Earl of Wiltshire!) <p></p> In 2003, the BBC filmed Philippa Gregory&#x2019;s novel, <i>The Other Boleyn Girl</i>. Henry VIII&#x2019;s interest in Mary (Natasha McElhone) is dated to to 1524, and Katherine of Aragon (why is she always shown as black-haired in films?) is improbably aware of the affair. Mary is manoeuvred by her family into becoming the King&#x2019;s mistress, but she loves her husband, William Carey, and only reluctantly succumbs. But as their intimacy deepens, she comes to favour Henry, and a rift opens between her and Carey. <p></p> William Stafford, who will become Mary&#x2019;s second husband, appears early on in the unlikely guise of a servant of the Boleyns, when he would have been about twelve years old! <p></p> Mary becomes pregnant in 1525. Her father is worried that the King will stray while she is unavailable to him, so he pushes Anne into Henry&#x2019;s path. Inevitably, Henry falls for Anne. Mary is shown being confined as a queen, taking to a darkened chamber in readiness for the birth. Henry VIII was discreet in his illicit amours, and these ordinances were laid down only for the Queen, so this is just pure silliness. <p></p> Mary gives birth to a son, but the Duke of Norfolk tells her that the King no longer desires her because he wants her sister. Only Stafford is there to support her. <p></p> Mary is forced to wait on Anne, whom she now hates, and to witness her flirting with Henry. Carey tells her to forget the King, and forces himself on her, fathering a daughter. But the chronology is skewed, as is the likely paternity of the children. Carey dies after Anne becomes queen in 1533 (in reality, he died in 1528). When Anne tries to wed Mary to the fictional Lord Farnley, she marries Stafford in secret. When she confesses, she is banished for disgracing the family. <p></p> Mary is then seen suggesting that Anne lie secretly with another man in order to conceive a son, when in reality, she was likely in Calais during Anne&#x2019;s fall. In the series, it is she who asks their brother George, &#x2018;Could you lie with her?&#x2019; Later, she comforts Anne for the loss of the son George has incestuously fathered, and after Anne&#x2019;s arrest, she attends her in the Tower. <p></p> There is no sense of politics in the film, as in the movie, <i>The Other Boleyn Girl</i> (2008), starring Scarlett Johansson as a rather vacuous Mary. The costumes are often anachronistic and the chronology shaky. The story is told on a superficial level, and follows a similar plot to the TV movie. At the end, Mary is seen watching Anne&#x2019;s execution; but the real Anne did not weep on the scaffold. The most far-fetched scene is where Mary rides back to court afterwards and snatches Anne&#x2019;s daughter Elizabeth, carrying her off to be reared with her own children in the country. <p></p> In the TV series <i>The Tudors</i> (2007-2010), Mary Boleyn (Perdita Weeks) appears in six episodes. From the moment you see the eighteenth-century coach in the opening shots of the series, you know that historical integrity is going to be an issue. Hopeless chronology, dated costumes and unforgivable factual errors spoil a series that is often well acted by a strong cast. <i>The Tudors</i> inhabits a world of its own: only occasionally do you get a sense of Tudor England. Many of the female characters, like Mary, look like modern fashion models with breast implants and teased hair. <p></p> We see the King of France pointing out Mary to Henry VIII at the Field of Cloth of Gold in 1520. When Henry later asks Mary what French graces she has learned, she offers him oral sex. Later, we see Mary waiting on her sister Anne and visiting Calais with the royal party. Anne and Mary are depicted as being very close and affectionate, which may not have been the case in real life. In the show it is Mary (not even recorded as being present) who carries the Princess Elizabeth to her christening. Later on a heavily pregnant Mary--had Anne not already noticed?--confesses that she has married Stafford secretly, and the Boleyns banish her from court. <p></p> Mary Boleyn is misrepresented in popular culture because of such films. It concerns me that the demarcation line between historical fact and fiction has now become blurred. Why would one ever want to change history? The truth, as Byron famously said, &#x2018;is stranger than fiction&#x2019;. <p></p><b>Alison Weir</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of many historical biographies, including <i>The Lady in the Tower, Mistress of the Monarchy, Henry VIII, Eleanor of Aquitaine, The Life of Elizabeth I,</i> and <i>The Six Wives of Henry VIII, </i>and of the novels <i>Captive Queen, Innocent Traitor,</i> and <i>The Lady Elizabeth</i>.

There is something fishy going on over in the isolated village of Stoyre, too. With a clear-eyed understanding of people and an uncommon degree of common sense, Macbeth solves these riddles almost effortlessly. His real problem is not crime, but avoiding promotion; each time he catches a wrongdoer or saves a child, he comes to the attention of his superiors, who feel his talents are wasted in Lochdubh. But his life there, with its cottage police station, his dog, his hens and sheep, and an attractive new journalist on hand, suits Macbeth very well. And though the villagers think him lazy and unambitious, they don't want to see him go, either, as they would lose their police station if he were transferred. The trademark charm of the series-quirky humor, eccentric characters, and dark overtones-is in full swing here; fans will be well pleased, and readers new to Lochdubh can enjoy this as a stand-alone volume.<br><i>Christine C.

Sloan learns that Mrs. Galloway had been a part of a dangerous drug trial, he assumes that her death may not have been entirely from natural causes, and when he hears of the suicide of a doctor also involved in the trial, Sloan sets out to learn more.</p><p>The Cardigan Protocol, the drug trial that Dr. Paul Meggie's been running for Gilroy Pharmaceuticals, has clearly gone out of control. One of the patients on the placebo has died, leaving a family howling malpractice; so has one of the patients on the real drug; and so has Dr. Meggie himself, an apparent suicide not quite good enough to fool Inspector C.D. Sloan and his canny pathologist. As he struggles to dope out the connections between the Cardigan tests at St. Ninian's and Berebury Hospitals and the lower-order experiments that have earned Gilroy the wrath of animal-rights activists, Sloan (A Going Concern, 1994, etc., etc.) sees the motives for Dr. Meggie's murder mushroom to a truly alarming extent. As clever and literate as ever, though even Aird loyalists will need a Ouija board to pluck the culprit from the drug-trial shallows. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Aird brings back the wry Detective Inspector C. D. Sloan, who is contending, as usual, with Colonel Blimp^-like Superintendent Leeyes and the captious Detective Constable Crosby. This time, the death in the local hospital of an extremely ill patient seems unremarkable until the son, dissatisfied with her care, insists on an investigation, and an anonymous phone call to the police suggests that the drug trial the patient was participating in was very dangerous indeed, if not deadly. When the doctor conducting the trial also turns up dead shortly thereafter, an apparent suicide, Sloan mournfully foregoes his weekend to learn about double-blind trials, medical ethics, and the interesting private life of the deceased doctor.

He explains that he&#x2019;s a dairy farmer on a kibbutz in Israel and has read some articles I&#x2019;ve written. He wants to tell me about his life&#x2019;s project. For the previous fifteen years, Jules has devoted his time to building a family tree. A really big tree. More of a forest.<br> <br>&#x201c;We have in our database about eighty thousand relatives of yours,&#x201d; he says.<br> <br>Eighty thousand. I try to wrap my head around that number. If he&#x2019;s right, my relatives could fill four Madison Square Gardens.<br> <br>The email gives me profoundly mixed feelings.<br> <br>On the one hand, as my wife, Julie, points out, I often feel like I have too many relatives already. I&#x2019;d be happy to trim a few branches. I&#x2019;m thinking of my cousin David, who, for his wedding, hired a little person dressed as a leprechaun to pop out from under his bride&#x2019;s dress and twerk with the guests. And then there&#x2019;s my brilliant but smug brother-in-law Eric, whose favorite phrase is the infuriating &#x201c;I think what you&#x2019;re trying to say is . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>The point is, do I really want to be part of this mega-tree? Plus, the email has some creepy NSA-like privacy-invasion vibes. How did this dairy farmer know all this about me? And why should I trust him?<br> <br>On the other hand, the less cynical hand, I&#x2019;m oddly moved. Here I am, sitting in my home office in New York City, subjected to endless Internet headlines about our world&#x2019;s seeming descent into disaster&#x2014;wars, racism&#x2014;and up pops this startling news about how I&#x2019;m connected to thousands of other humans across the globe. These newfound cousins would likely come in all shapes, sizes, and ethnic backgrounds: tall cousins and short cousins, white cousins and black cousins, carnivorous cousins and vegan cousins, gay cousins and straight cousins, cilantro-loving cousins and cousins who believe cilantro tastes like Satan&#x2019;s unwashed tube socks.<br> <br>All of us different, all of us linked.<br> <br>What I&#x2019;m trying to say (as my brother-in-law explained to me later) is that I experienced a profound sense of belonging. I felt a part of something larger than myself. I glimpsed the Ultimate Social Network.<br> <br>The timing of the email couldn&#x2019;t have been better. During the last several years, I&#x2019;ve become increasingly obsessed with family, which might be an inherited trait. When I was a kid, my dad spent years building a family tree. Not quite eighty thousand, but it reached back multiple generations. He&#x2019;d show me the names of my Polish and Ukrainian great-grandparents. He&#x2019;d tell me about their lives. How they were farmers and general store owners; one even found a niche selling peacocks to nobles. How some fled the Russian pogroms by hiding in a haystack on the back of a cart. How my great-grandfather was supposed to pick up his wife and kids at Ellis Island but missed their arrival because he was eating a second bowl of soup. How the wife and kids had to stay overnight in the detention facility, confused, ignorant, and anxious they&#x2019;d be sent back to Poland.<br> <br>As a young man, I scoffed at these tales. I was an obnoxious little rebel who rejected all institutions, including family. I preferred to spend zero time thinking about my ancestors. Why should I care about these people, just because we happen to share some DNA by accident of birth? It&#x2019;s not rational. It&#x2019;s arbitrary. It&#x2019;s a relic of the past.<br> <br>But as so often happens to people, I got older, I had kids, and I magically turned into my dad. Now I spend most of my time thinking about family: How can I give my three young sons a sense of belonging? What kind of wisdom and ethics from my ancestors can I pass along to my kids?<br> <br>And then comes Jules Feldman&#x2019;s email. It stays in my mind the next day. And the next.

In some traditions, the path to liberation extends over lifetimes of diligent practice, but Dzogchen is an accelerated way to achieve self-perfection. After many years of formal study, Chogyal Namkhai Norbu was initiated into this less-formal practice, which is one of the highest yet most accessible of Tibetan Buddhist teachings. Namkhai Norbu eventually made his way to Italy to teach, where John Shane transcribed and translated Namkhai Norbu's lectures, putting together what is now one of the most popular books on Dzogchen. Namkhai Norbu makes it clear that these teachings are not a handbook for practice but rather an overview of Dzogchen, notably its three divisions: the base, the path, and the fruit. The ultimate and immediate goal is to achieve the primordial state of non-dual awareness, the one taste, and to maintain it. With colorful anecdotes from his own experience (finding an ancient text manifested in a dream, for example, and visiting eccentric cave yogis), Namkhai Norbu's teachings illustrate that Dzogchen is not just theory but the way to a new, and almost incomprehensible, way of being. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Chogyal Namkhai Norbu examines the spiritual path from the viewpoint of Dzogchen. He interweaves his life story with Dzogchen teachings, making them accessible through his living example. He discusses his education and how he met his principal master who showed him the real meaning of "direct introduction to Dzogchen." <p>"One of the most significant contributions to the understanding of Tibetan Buddhism to have appeared in recent years."--The Middle Way, Journal of the Buddhist Society, London </p><p>Namkhai Norbu was born in eastern Tibet in 1938, and at the age of three was recognized as the incarnation of a great Dzogchen master. He received the full traditional education of a "tulku" or reincarnate lama, and went on to study and practice with several great masters in Tibet. </p><p>"The author distinguished between Dzogchen exposition and instruction; the former is what books do; the latter requires the direct teaching of a master. Instruction entails actual transmission of the primordial state from the master to the student. The student's task is then to engage in practices that enable direct access to that state -- and eventually to abide uninterruptedly in the primoridial state, even while living an ordinary life."-- The Quest</p></p><h2>Danube: A Sentimental Journey from the Source to the Black Sea</h2><p>An Italian critic of culture recounts both his personal adventures and ancient lore and literature surrounding the Danube River and Middle European civilization, including references to Kafka, Freud, Marcus Aurelius, and Ovid</p><p>This is a very Italian book, reminiscent of Italo Calvino and Roberto Calasso. Part history, part philosophy, part travelogue, this is literature in the richest, most amply rewarding sense. Writing with tremendous exuberance, Claudio Magris has produced a paean to what H�lderlin called "the river of melody"--the Danube, Europe's main artery, and the heart of that elusive but fascinating zone known as Mitteleuropa. Magris is certainly erudite, and not afraid of displaying his erudition, but he also has a fine sense of humor and an eye for the absurd. According to one eminent sedimentologist, he tells us, the source of the Danube is a leaky tap in a remote mountain farmhouse. And of course, the one color it isn't, ever, is blue. The Hungarians call it blond, apparently. "Muddy yellow" might be more accurate, says the author. His greatest passion, however, is people: poets, singers, murderers, emperors, Dracula, Kafka, Wittgenstein , Josef Mengele--all human life is here. And it makes doubly fascinating reading for having been written back in 1986, when brutes like Ceaucescu were still in power and the Iron Curtain was still in place, though beginning to tremble slightly in the wind of history. <i>--Christopher Hart, Amazon.co.uk</i>In <b>Danube</b> the author sets his finger on the pulse of Central Europe, the crucible of a culture that draws on influences of East and West, of Christendom and Islam. In this journey through the history and culture of the Danube lands, Claudio Magris, whose knowledge is encyclopaedic and curiosity limitless, guides the reader along the course of the river, from its source in the Bavarian hills through Austro-Hungary and the Balkans to the Black Sea. In each town he raises the ghosts that inhabit the houses and monuments, from Ovid and Marcus Aurelius to Kafka and Canetti. The Danube is the great artery of that elusive territory known as Mitteleuropa, from which so many of the most fascinating people and ideas of European history have emerged, and Magris has produced a wonderful celebration of it in a book that effortlessly combines erudition and writing of the highest quality.</p><h2>The Queen of Attolia</h2><p><i>Revenge</i><p>When Eugenides, the Thief of Eddis, stole Hamiathes's Gift, the Queen of Attolia lost more than a mythical relic. She lost face. Everyone knew that Eudenides had outwitted and escaped her. To restore her reputation and reassert her power, the Queen of Attolia will go to any length and accept any help that is offered...she will risk her country to execute the perfect revenge. </p><p> <i>...but</i> </p><p> Eugenides can steal anything. And he taunts the Queen of Attolia, moving through her strongholds seemingly at will. So Attolia waits, secure in the knowledge that the Thief will slip, that he will haunt her palace one too many times. </p><p> <i> ...at what price?</i> </p><p> When Eugenides finds his small mountain country at war with Attolia, he must steal a man, he must steal a queen, he must steal peace. But his greatest triumph--and his greatest loss--comes in capturing something that the Queen of Attolia thought she had sacrificed long ago...</p><p>Books for the Teen Age 2001 (NYPL) and Bulletin Blue Ribbon Best of 2000 Award</p></p><p>In the firelit torture chamber the executioner's sword descends--and the Eugenides--the Thief of Eddis--no longer has his clever right hand. The Queen of Attolia sits calmly and watches the dreadful amputation behind her carefully cultivated mask of coldness, but later agonizes over what she has done to him. At the same time, she rages at herself for not hanging her captured prisoner outright. <p> Readers who first met Eugenides as the rascally teenager Gen in the Newbery Honor-winning <i>The Thief</i> will find that in this sequel he deepens through suffering and loss, but keeps the same witty talent for elaborate, crafty schemes of espionage and theft. Caught between two rival queens in a landscape based on that which surrounds the Mediterranean Sea, Eugenides is loyal to Eddis as her Queen's Thief, but in love (despite himself) with the beautiful and seemingly ruthless Attolia. In her small mountain country, Eddis controls the only bridge between the valley nation of Sounis and the coastal kingdom of Attolia, while all three are threatened by the ships of the powerful Medes.

At the start of 1939 Renia began a diary. &#x201c;I just want a friend. I want somebody to talk to about my everyday worries and joys. Somebody who would feel what I feel, who would believe me, who would never reveal my secrets. A human being can never be such a friend and that&#x2019;s why I have decided to look for a confidant in the form of a diary.&#x201d; And so begins an extraordinary document of an adolescent girl&#x2019;s hopes and dreams. By the fall of 1939, Renia and her younger sister Elizabeth (n�e Ariana) were staying with their grandparents in Przemysl, a city in the south, just as the German and Soviet armies invaded Poland. Cut off from their mother, who was in Warsaw, Renia and her family were plunged into war.</p><br><p>Like Anne Frank, Renia&#x2019;s diary became a record of her daily life as the Nazis spread throughout Europe. Renia writes of her mundane school life, her daily drama with best friends, falling in love with her boyfriend Zygmund, as well as the agony of missing her mother, separated by bombs and invading armies. Renia had aspirations to be a writer, and the diary is filled with her poignant and thoughtful poetry. When she was forced into the city&#x2019;s ghetto with the other Jews, Zygmund is able to smuggle her out to hide with his parents, taking Renia out of the ghetto, but not, ultimately to safety. The diary ends in July 1942, completed by Zygmund, after Renia is murdered by the Gestapo.</p><br><p><i>Renia's Diary</i> has been translated from the original Polish, and includes a preface, afterword, and notes by her surviving sister, Elizabeth Bellak. An extraordinary historical document, Renia Spiegel survives through the beauty of her words and the efforts of those who loved her and preserved her legacy.</p></p><p><p>RENIA SPIEGEL was born to a Jewish family in Poland in 1924. She began her diary at the start of 1939, right before the invasion of Poland by the German and Soviet armies. In 1942, she was forced to move to a ghetto, but was smuggled out by her boyfriend and went into hiding with his parents. She was discovered by the Gestapo and murdered on July 30, 1942.</p><p>ELIZABETH BELLAK (n�e Ariana Spiegel), born in 1930, was a child actress once called &#x201c;the Polish Shirley Temple.&#x201d; In 1942 she and her mother fled to Warsaw, and then to Austria, finally arriving in New York City, where she lives today.</p><p>"A must-read." &#x2015;<b><i>Addison Independent</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;A terribly poignant work that conveys the brutal reality of the time through intimate connection with a young person.&#x201d;&#x2015;<b><i>Kirkus Review</i> </b></p><p>&#x201c;Moving [and] riveting... this epic, layered story of survival serves as an important Holocaust document.&#x201d;&#x2015;<i><b>Publishers Weekly</b></i></p><p>&#x201c;Renia Spiegel, a young girl so filled with a zest for life and possessed of an ability to describe in prose and in poetry the beauty of the world around her, was denied with one bullet what she so wanted: a future...Those who saved the diary and those who worked to bring it to print, have &#x201c;rescued&#x201d; her.

Overnight, he became famous and his book, <i>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,</i> became the classic American fairy tale. By popular demand, a host of delightful sequels followed, some even better than the book that started it all.<br>Dorothy and the Wizard are back in this sequel, and this time it all begins not with a cyclone but with a California earthquake. With her friends Zeb the farm boy, Eureka the kitten, and Jim the cab-horse, Dorothy plummets through a huge crack in the center of the earth. Later they are joined by the Wizard, carrying nine tiny piglets (each no bigger than a mouse). In one thrilling adventure after another, they pass through lands as fantastic as dreams, are stunned by incredible wonders, and make many a narrow escape from danger.<br>In the Land of the Mangaboos, people are vegetables, and the houses, made of glass, are grown, not built! Eating a marvelous fruit in the Valley of Voe makes the inhabitants &#x2014; including ferocious bears &#x2014; invisible. And in the deathly silent land of the flying gargoyles, everything is made of wood.<br>The best treat of all comes when the intrepid travelers come back to the magical Land of Oz, where they are greeted by our old friends the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, the Cowardly Lion, and other familiar, strange, and amusing characters. Unexpected complications arise when Jim the cab-horse enters a race against a horse made of wood and when Eureka the kitten is accused of having eaten one of the piglets. Of course all comes right in the end, but not before the author's wonderful imagination, playful wit, and warm humor have touched our hearts and made us laugh, demonstrating once again why L. Frank Baum has been called "The American Lewis Carroll."<br>Reprinted here complete with all the enchanting original drawings by John R.

Now in its third edition, this award winning Atlas (1995 Best Atlas Design, American Congress of Surveying and Mapping) uses Benchmark's exclusive Landscape Maps&#x2122;, -- a unique cartographic style that combines terrain shading (relief) and altitude coloration. <p>The twenty-four pages of Landscape Maps&#x2122; show the topography and road network in a way that's both beautiful and practical at a scale of 1" = 8.3 miles (1:525,000). Roads are classified by importance--from Interstate highways to dirt roads--and all populated settlements and locales are shown and included in a comprehensive index . Each page has generous overlap with adjoining pages, and the new fourth edition includes all of the new recently completed four-lane divided highways. </p><p>A separate section in the Atlas clearly shows ten different classifications of public lands, including national forests, national parks, BLM and Indian lands at the same scale as the Landscape Maps&#x2122; (1:525,000). The Atlas also includes street maps for Albuquerque, Rio Rancho, Santa Fe, Roswell and Las Cruces and nine pages of recreation information.</p></p><p>For navigating around the state, my favorite map is the New Mexico Road &amp; Recreation Atlas. -- <i>Bob Julyan. Albuquerque Journal, April 29, 1999.</i><br><br>The road network, from interstates to roads suitable only for four-wheel-drive vehicles, is clearly shown. -- <i>RV Traveling.

From the setting in the simple mountain cabin, No-Eyes takes her on a sometimes frightening journey through time, viewing the upheavals to come through a unique perspective, on timeless paths that few have ever traveled.</p><p>Second in a celebrated and best-selling series, which includes <em>Spirit Song</em>, <em>Dreamwalker</em>, <em>Phantoms Afoot</em>, <em>Daybreak</em>, <em>Soul Sounds</em>, <em>Mountains, Meadows, and Moonbeams</em>(Young Spirit), and <em>Whispered Wisdom</em>, <em>Phoenix Rising</em> gives the reader an understanding of the relationship between the Earth Mother and the creatures who inhabit her domain. It's a book that is already a classic for its philosophical insight and the powerful lyricism of the author's portrayal of the beautiful mountains of Colorado. And, as always, the unique relationship between teacher and student is delightfully rendered.</p></p><p></p><h2>Drawing Now: Eight Propositions</h2><p>From John Currin's old-master-style Playboy bunnies to Elizabeth Peyton's fin-de-siecle portraits; from Julie Mehretu's dizzying, multilayered architectural landscapes to Shahzia Sikander's multipatterned miniature ones; from Yoshitomo Nara's angry and enigmatic little girls to Kara Walker's stereotypical negresses; and from Barry McGee's caricatures of urban graffiti to Matthew Ritchie's cosmological diagrams--drawing is back, if it ever went away. In contrast to the digitized, multimedia direction that much of contemporary art has taken in the past decade, drawing has become the major mode of expression for many of today's most important young artists. <i>Drawing Now</i>, published to accompany the first major survey of contemporary drawings at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 15 years, contains more than 100 color reproductions of work by 26 international artists, both well-known and emerging, that demonstrate the fascinating variety of methods and approaches, mediums and scales, apparent in this old-again, new-again art. Accompanying essays by the exhibition's curator, Laura Hoptman, explore eight themes that she perceives in the field--Drafting &amp; Architecture, Mental Maps &amp; Metaphysics, Popular Culture &amp; National Culture, Fashion, Likeness &amp; Allegory, Envisioning a City, Science &amp; Art, Comics &amp; Other Subcultures, Ornament &amp; Crime--and provide key impulses behind drawing's recent resurgence.</p><p>Laura Hoptman is Curator of Contemporary Art at the Carnegie Museum of Art, a post that includes the organization of the 2004 Carnegie International. She previously served as Assistant Curator in the Department of Drawings at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, where she was responsible for exhibitions of work by Ricci Albenda, John Brock, Maurizio Cattelan, and Rirkrit Tiravanija.

Bill, the popularity of <i>Fables</i> hasn&#x2019;t waned since its debut in 2002. What do you think is the greatest appeal of the title? </strong></p> <p><strong>A. </strong>Bill Willingham: I think a couple of things. <i>Fables</i> draws on folklore, which by definition is stories that everyone owns. Every single person in the entire world owns these stories. It&#x2019;s not like it&#x2019;s collectively owned&#x2014;if we want to do a new Snow White story, we don&#x2019;t have to all come together and determine &#x201c;This is what it&#x2019;s going to be.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s individual ownership of this vast, vast library of stories. So everyone, by virtue of being &#x201c;folk&#x201d; in &#x201c;folk lore,&#x201d; is born rich, because everyone owns all of this, and can do all of this with it. So maybe the loyal readership on <i>Fables</i> is everyone protecting their investment, saying, &#x201c;This is my stuff and it&#x2019;s paying off well.&#x201d; And I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s entirely facetious. You <i>know</i> these people; you&#x2019;ve heard these stories forever (&#x201c;you&#x201d; being the reader). It&#x2019;s like an old friend: &#x201c;Have you heard what&#x2019;s been happening to Snow White, lately? I haven&#x2019;t heard from her in years, what&#x2019;s she up to?&#x201d; I don&#x2019;t trust its popularity though. I still feel like <i>Fables</i> is going to make it some day. I don&#x2019;t count on the readers being there from issue to issue. I don&#x2019;t take the reader for granted.</p> <p><strong>Q. You've touched on almost every fairy tale and literary classic&#x2014;from Beauty and the Beast to Little Boy Blue to most recently the Wizard of Oz. Growing up, what were some of your personal favorite tales and how has that informed your approach to writing it in this series? </strong></p> <p><strong>A. </strong>Bill Willingham: My personal and favorite tales growing up, possibly my all-time favorite fairy tale character was the Big Bad Wolf because that was the only one I was aware of early on as a kid appearing in more than one fairy tale. Big Bad Wolf went after the pigs and didn&#x2019;t quite make it there. Big Bad Wolf went after Red Riding Hood, didn&#x2019;t quite make it there. So, I just love the fact that just like in comics, fairy tales can show up in different stories. Which is probably why I made him into a hero in <i>Fables</i>. He would have made a great villain, still, but I&#x2019;d use him once or twice and then I&#x2019;d have to get rid of him. Because the worst thing in the world is the villain who keeps on coming back. Then it&#x2019;s not really a story about the villain but about incompetent heroes. </p> <p>I used to love <i>Fractured Fairytales</i> as a kid, so most of those characters had to show up in <i>Fables</i>. I think I got most of them, but I'm not certain.</p> <p>Little Boy Blue was never meant to be an important character. He was just there, foot in the office, someone for Snow White to talk to. He kind of expanded his character in the book.</p> <p><strong>Q. As mentioned previously, these characters have existed for a long, long time, and people have a certain level of love and attachment to them. What would you say is some of the most surprising feedback you've gotten? </strong></p> <p><strong>A. </strong>Bill Willingham: Almost none of it comes as a surprise. And I don&#x2019;t mean that to sound jaded. What surprises me most is that real folklore scholars have done papers on <i>Fables</i>&#x2014;sometimes I&#x2019;ve found out about it accidentally, sometimes they let me know. I&#x2019;m just a guy that&#x2019;s spinning comic book stories. They ask, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your research methods?&#x201d; and such and refer to me as a &#x201c;well-known folklore scholar.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m not a scholar on anything. I read the stuff I like, and if it stays with me, I like it enough to spin a story out of it. But the fact that the important intellectual academic is aware of this surprises me. </p> <p>The thing that doesn't surprise me is that a German folklore specialist will correct me and say that the Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is the not the same Snow White as Snow White and Rose Red. Even though in English, both translate to &#x201c;Snow White,&#x201d; they are two very different names in German. I was aware of this, but we&#x2019;re doing this in English, so I&#x2019;m going to make them the same person. They're two fairytales that don&#x2019;t really match up, but I felt that it was challenging to make them the same person.</p> <p><strong>Q. Has there been a fjairy tale or literary character that you&#x2019;ve found challenging to adapt as a player in <i>Fables</i>? </strong></p> <p><strong>A. </strong>Bill Willingham: The humble and obvious answer is all of them. The other answer is a few. Modernizing them without losing what was important about them is always a challenge. Snow White for example. I wanted her as a tough as nails businesswoman, not taking any nonsense from the whiny bastards. The challenges were was there anything in the original stories that predicated this. In the original stories, she had true love. But in our story, Prince Charming is a womanizer, so true love didn&#x2019;t last a while. Prince Charming had many episodes of &#x201c;true love&#x201d; down the road, so she gets betrayed by Prince Charming by her own sister, she gets betrayed by her own stepmother with the poisoned apple, she gets betrayed by her original mom who sent her away. With Snow White, the obvious thing here was &#x201c;trust issues.&#x201d; If you have trust issues, you either become the perpetual victim, or you become this strong, &#x201c;No one&#x2019;s going to hurt me again because I&#x2019;m going to become a captain of my own life.&#x201d; The problem is, when you do a strong &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to take any nonsense&#x201d; character in anything, people love that. But there&#x2019;s always going to be people who will complain that she&#x2019;s an emasculating hateful woman. I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s the case. Luckily the series has lasted long enough where we&#x2019;ve been able to show many sides to her personality. That was a challenge. </p> <p><strong>Q. With over 100 issues, two original graphic novels and a novel in the rearview mirror, are there any loose plot threads that you lament not getting to? </strong></p> <p><strong>A.</strong> Bill Willingham: Oh, yeah. Not only loose plot threads that were things that we planned from the beginning, but also every single story suggests so many other stories to follow up on. For example, when the Arabian <i>Fables</i> showed up, we could have changed it to an all-Arabian book; we could have spent a hundred years just exploring that corner. Instead, we didn&#x2019;t and we went back to our core cast. But it&#x2019;s like the population grows. The stories are begetting other stories ideas and pretty soon we have this overcrowded earth and there are hundreds of stories that we won&#x2019;t be able to get to because, unfortunately, medicine is letting us down and I&#x2019;m not immortal yet. Hal Foster, when he was doing <i>Prince Valiant</i>, was doing this incredible sprawling story that went on for more than thirty years of his life, so we saw Prince Valiant as a kid, we saw him growing up, falling in love and then we saw his kids grow up. This was done in real time, so we didn&#x2019;t jump ahead years. I would love to be able to do that. </p> <p><strong>Q. <i>Fairest</i> is a series that serves as a sister series to <i>Fables</i>, focusing specifically on the lovely ladies of Fabletown. What are some of stories you have planned? Will they mostly be present day tales? Flashbacks? </strong></p> <p><strong>A. </strong>Bill Willingham: It mostly is a mix. The first one concentrates on Briar Rose, where we had the present day &#x201c;what happening in her life,&#x201d; but in order to explain why she&#x2019;s in the predicament, we showed her origin with the seven fairies that gave her blessings and then the fairy that was slighted. </p> <p>We just started a Rapunzel storyline written by wonderful South African writer Lauren Beukes. Once again, it doesn&#x2019;t exactly take place in present day. It takes place years ago before the first <i>Fables</i> issue. But it also takes place then, and in ancient Japan. Because they are all essentially immortal characters, we have the ability to spill all over the time map.</p> <p>The one to follow, which will introduce a brand-new East Indian folklore character will once again take place in present day with carefully, strategically-placed flashbacks to see how she got to where she is and how she got to the places she&#x2019;s been.</p> <p><strong>Q. <i>In the Fables: Werewolves of the Heartland</i> original graphic novel, you're telling an epic Bigby Wolf story. Why did you decide to spin this off into a separate OGN rather than keep it in the series? </strong></p> <p><strong>A. </strong>Bill Willingham: It&#x2019;s an epic Bigby Wolf story. For some time&#x2014;this story is at least three years in production (and then some)&#x2014;we wanted Bigby Wolf to have this story, to go out and have a story and be the Big Bad Wolf. Since it was a single character and predicated on him leaving the rest of the community for a while, it seemed to natural to spin it off into it&#x2019;s own graphic novel. </p> <p><strong>Q. You&#x2019;ve been writing <i>Fables</i> for a decade now. Looking towards the future, how much more do you have in you? Is there another spin-off you'd love to do?</strong></p> <p><strong>A. </strong>Bill Willingham: I&#x2019;m very old. I&#x2019;ll probably die soon before we get to it. There&#x2019;s always another spin-off I&#x2019;d love to do. With <i>Fables</i>, we didn&#x2019;t create a story, we created a setting. It&#x2019;s a fictional world where all types of stories can take place. People ask me, &#x201c;When is <i>Fables</i> coming to an end?&#x201d; The clear answer is that stories end all the time. But then because the stories are in this setting such that it is, we start it all the time. So yes, there&#x2019;s always going to be a desire to spin off more and more stories. </p> <p><strong>Q. Which Bigby Wolf will we see in <i>Werewolves of the Heartland</i>? The gruff, law-keeping chain smoker from earlier in the series, or the caring father he's been lately? </strong></p> <p><strong>A. </strong>Bill Willingham: You&#x2019;re going have references to the caring father he&#x2019;s been lately. You&#x2019;re going to see a bit of the gruff Bigby Wolf. But you&#x2019;re also going to see a good deal of the Bigby Wolf he&#x2019;s been keeping contained for entire <i>Fables</i> series, which is the old monster he used to be. </p> <p><strong>Q. Which do you prefer, the original graphic novel format where the story is finite and self-contained, or the spanning <i>Fables</i> series in which the story can go several different directions at any point?</strong></p> <p><strong>A. </strong>Bill Willingham: I love all my children equally. Either one, because either one has freedoms that the other format doesn&#x2019;t and either one has restrictions that the other one doesn&#x2019;t. And surprisingly enough, the things that you&#x2019;re not allowed to lead to better storytelling than the things you are allowed to do. </p>Bill Willingham has been writing, and sometimes drawing, comics for more than twenty years. During that time he&#39;s had work published by nearly every comics publisher in the business and he&#39;s written many critically-acclaimed comic book series, including Elementals, FABLES, JACK OF FABLES, ROBIN, SHADOWPACT and SALVATION RUN. A multiple winner of the Eisner Award, Willingham has also been nominated for the International Horror Guild award. Bill lives somewhere near a good poker room.</p><h2>The Colossus of New York: A City in 13 Parts</h2><p>In a dazzlingly original work of nonfiction, the award-winning novelist Colson Whitehead re-creates the exuberance, the chaos, the promise, and the heartbreak of New York. Here is a literary love song that will entrance anyone who has lived in&#x2014;or spent time&#x2014;in the greatest of American cities.<b><br></b><br>A masterful evocation of the city that never sleeps, <i>The Colossus of New York</i> captures the city&#x2019;s inner and outer landscapes in a series of vignettes, meditations, and personal memories. Colson Whitehead conveys with almost uncanny immediacy the feelings and thoughts of longtime residents and of newcomers who dream of making it their home; of those who have conquered its challenges; and of those who struggle against its cruelties. <br><br>Whitehead&#x2019;s style is as multilayered and multifarious as New York itself: Switching from third person, to first person, to second person, he weaves individual voices into a jazzy musical composition that perfectly reflects the way we experience the city. There is a funny, knowing riff on what it feels like to arrive in New York for the first time; a lyrical meditation on how the city is transformed by an unexpected rain shower; and a wry look at the ferocious battle that is commuting. The plaintive notes of the lonely and dispossessed resound in one passage, while another captures those magical moments when the city seems to be talking directly to you, inviting you to become one with its rhythms. <br><br><i>The Colossus of New York</i> is a remarkable portrait of life in the big city. Ambitious in scope, gemlike in its details, it is at once an unparalleled tribute to New York and the ideal introduction to one of the most exciting writers working today.</p><p><p>COLSON WHITEHEAD was born and raised in New York City. He is the author of <i>The Intuitionist</i> and <i>John Henry Days</i>, and is a recipient of a Whiting Award and a MacArthur Fellowship. He lives in Brooklyn.</p>City Limits<br><br>I'm here because I was born here and thus ruined for anywhere else, but I don't know about you. Maybe you're from here, too, and sooner or later it will come out that we used to live a block away from each other and didn't even know it. Or maybe you moved here a couple years ago for a job. Maybe you came here for school. Maybe you saw the brochure. The city has spent a considerable amount of time and money putting the brochure together, what with all the movies, TV shows and songs--the whole If You Can Make It There business. The city also puts a lot of effort into making your hometown look really drab and tiny, just in case you were wondering why it's such a drag to go back sometimes.<br><br>No matter how long you have been here, you are a New Yorker the first time you say, That used to be Munsey's, or That used to be the Tic Toc Lounge.

Maybe you were in a cab leaving the airport when the skyline first roused itself into view. All your worldly possessions were in the trunk, and in your hand you held an address on a piece of paper. Look: there's the Empire State Building, over there are the Twin Towers. Somewhere in that fantastic, glorious mess was the address on the piece of paper, your first home here. Maybe your parents dragged you here for a vacation when you were a kid and towed you up and down the gigantic avenues to shop for Christmas gifts. The only skyscrapers visible from your stroller were the legs of adults, but you got to know the ground pretty well and started to wonder why some sidewalks sparkle at certain angles, and others don't. Maybe you came to visit your old buddy, the one who moved here last summer, and there was some mix-up as to where you were supposed to meet. You stepped out of Penn Station into the dizzying hustle of Eighth Avenue and fainted. Freeze it there: that instant is the first brick in your city.<br><br>I started building my New York on the uptown No. 1 train. My first city memory is of looking out a subway window as the train erupted from the tunnel on the way to 125th Street and palsied up onto the elevated tracks. It's the early 70's, so everything is filthy. Which means everything is still filthy, because that is my city and I'm sticking to it. I still call it the Pan Am Building, not out of affectation, but because that's what it is. For that new transplant from Des Moines, who is starting her first week of work at a Park Avenue South insurance firm, that titan squatting over Grand Central is the Met Life Building, and for her it always will be. She is wrong, of course--when I look up there, I clearly see the gigantic letters spelling out Pan Am, don't I? And of course I am wrong, in the eyes of the old-timers who maintain the myth that there was a time before Pan Am.<br><br>History books and public television documentaries are always trying to tell you all sorts of "facts" about New York. That Canal Street used to be a canal. That Bryant Park used to be a reservoir. It's all hokum. I've been to Canal Street, and the only time I ever saw a river flow through it was during the last water-main explosion. Never listen to what people tell you about old New York, because if you didn't witness it, it is not a part of your New York and might as well be Jersey. Except for that bit about the Dutch buying Manhattan for 24 bucks--there are and always will be braggarts who "got in at the right time."<br><br>There are eight million naked cities in this naked city--they dispute and disagree. The New York City you live in is not my New York City; how could it be? This place multiplies when you're not looking. We move over here, we move over there. Over a lifetime, that adds up to a lot of neighborhoods, the motley construction material of your jerry-built metropolis. Your favorite newsstands, restaurants, movie theaters, subway stations and barbershops are replaced by your next neighborhood's favorites. It gets to be quite a sum. Before you know it, you have your own personal skyline.<br><br>Go back to your old haunts in your old neighborhoods and what do you find: they remain and have disappeared. The greasy spoon, the deli, the dry cleaner you scouted out when you first arrived and tried to make those new streets yours: they are gone. But look past the windows of the travel agency that replaced your pizza parlor. Beyond the desks and computers and promo posters for tropical adventures, you can still see Neapolitan slices cooling, the pizza cutter lying next to half a pie, the map of Sicily on the wall. It is all still there, I assure you. The man who just paid for a trip to Jamaica sees none of that, sees his romantic getaway, his family vacation, what this little shop on this little street has granted him. The disappeared pizza parlor is still here because you are here, and when the beauty parlor replaces the travel agency, the gentleman will still have his vacation. And that lady will have her manicure.<br><br>You swallow hard when you discover that the old coffee shop is now a chain pharmacy, that the place where you first kissed so-and-so is now a discount electronics retailer, that where you bought this very jacket is now rubble behind a blue plywood fence and a future office building. Damage has been done to your city. You say, It happened overnight. But of course it didn't. Your pizza parlor, his shoeshine stand, her hat store: when they were here, we neglected them. For all you know, the place closed down moments after the last time you walked out the door. (Ten months ago? Six years? Fifteen? You can't remember, can you?) And there have been five stores in that spot before the travel agency. Five different neighborhoods coming and going between then and now, other people's other cities. Or fifteen, twenty-five, a hundred neighborhoods. Thousands of people pass that storefront every day, each one haunting the streets of his or her own New York, not one of them seeing the same thing.<br><br>We can never make proper goodbyes. It was your last ride in a Checker cab and you had no warning. It was the last time you were going to have Lake Tung Ting shrimp in that kinda shady Chinese restaurant and you had no idea. If you had known, perhaps you would have stepped behind the counter and shaken everyone's hand, pulled out the disposable camera and issued posing instructions. But you had no idea. There are unheralded tipping points, a certain number of times that we will unlock the front door of an apartment. At some point you were closer to the last time than you were to the first time, and you didn't even know it. You didn't know that each time you passed the threshold you were saying goodbye.<br><br>I never got a chance to say goodbye to some of my old buildings. Some I lived in, others were part of a skyline I thought would always be there. And they never got a chance to say goodbye to me. I think they would have liked to--I refuse to believe in their indifference. You say you know these streets pretty well? The city knows you better than any living person because it has seen you when you are alone. It saw you steeling yourself for the job interview, slowly walking home after the late date, tripping over nonexistent impediments on the sidewalk. It saw you wince when the single frigid drop fell from the air-conditioner twelve stories up and zapped you. It saw the bewilderment on your face as you stepped out of the stolen matinee, incredulous that there was still daylight after such a long movie. It saw you half-running up the street after you got the keys to your first apartment. The city saw all that. Remembers too.<br><br>Consider what all your old apartments would say if they got together to swap stories. They could piece together the starts and finishes of your relationships, complain about your wardrobe and musical tastes, gossip about who you are after midnight. 7J says, So that's what happened to Lucy--I knew it would never work out. You picked up yoga, you put down yoga, you tried various cures. You tried on selves and got rid of them, and this makes your old rooms wistful: why must things change? 3R goes, Saxophone, you say--I knew him when he played guitar. Cherish your old apartments and pause for a moment when you pass them. Pay tribute, for they are the caretakers of your reinventions.<br><br> Our streets are calendars containing who we were and who we will be next. We see ourselves in this city every day when we walk down the sidewalk and catch our reflections in store windows, seek ourselves in this city each time we reminisce about what was there fifteen, ten, forty years ago, because all our old places are proof that we were here. One day the city we built will be gone, and when it goes, we go. When the buildings fall, we topple, too.<br><br>Maybe we become New Yorkers the day we realize that New York will go on without us. To put off the inevitable, we try to fix the city in place, remember it as it was, doing to the city what we would never allow to be done to ourselves. The kid on the uptown No. 1 train, the new arrival stepping out of Grand Central, the jerk at the intersection who doesn't know east from west: those people don't exist anymore, ceased to be a couple of apartments ago, and we wouldn't have it any other way. New York City does not hold our former selves against us. Perhaps we can extend the same courtesy.<br><br>Our old buildings still stand because we saw them, moved in and out of their long shadows, were lucky enough to know them for a time. They are a part of the city we carry around. It is hard to imagine that something will take their place, but at this very moment the people with the right credentials are considering how to fill the craters. The cement trucks will roll up and spin their bellies, the jackhammers will rattle, and after a while the postcards of the new skyline will be available for purchase. Naturally we will cast a wary ...</p><h2>Van Gogh Compl.Paintings</h2><p>A chronological collection of reprinted works by Vincent Van Gogh in black-and-white and color accompanied by detailed history of the artist&#39;s life.</p><p></p><h2>Knowledge Is Power: How Magic, the Government and an Apocalyptic Vision Helped Francis Bacon to Create Modern Science (Icon Science)</h2><p>Francis Bacon - a leading figure in the history of science - never made a major discovery, provided a lasting explanation of any physical phenomena or revealed any hidden laws of nature.

Zoroaster)&#x2014;perhaps the greatest religious lawgiver of the ancient world&#x2014;and his vast influence.<br><br>In Persia more than three thousand years ago, Zarathustra spoke of a single universal god, the battle between good and evil, the devil, heaven and hell, and an eventual end to the world&#x2014;foreshadowing the core beliefs of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Moving from present to past, Paul Kriwaczek examines the effects of the prophet&#x2019;s teachings on the spiri-tual and daily lives of diverse peoples. Beginning in the year 2000 with New Year&#x2019;s festivities in Iran, he walks us back through Nietzsche&#x2019;s nineteenth-century interpretation of Zarathustra to the Cathars of thirteenth-century France and the ninth-century Bulgars; from ancient Rome to the time of Alexander the Great&#x2019;s destruction of the Persian Empire; and, finally, to the time of Zarathustra himself. <br><br>Not only an enthralling travel book, <b><i>In Search of Zarathustra</i></b> is also a revelation of the importance of the prophet, and a brilliantly conceived and lucid explication of the belief systems that helped shape the European Enlightenment, the Middle Ages, the Dark Ages, and the beginning of the Christian era. It is an enthralling study of a little-explored subject.</p><p>Paul Kriwaczek was born in Vienna in 1937. At the age of two he fled Vienna and the Nazi threat with his parents, eventually arriving in England. After qualifying as a dental surgeon in 1962 and traveling extensively in Asia and Africa&#x2014;including a two-year stint as the only European dentist in Kabul&#x2014;he joined the BBC as a specialist in Central and South Asian affairs, and then BBC Television as a producer. He took up writing full-time in the 1990s. He lives in London.<b>Chapter 1<br>An Idea for Now<br></b><br><i>The Golden Road to Samarkand<br></i><br>We bowled along the road into Uzbekistan from neighbouring Tajikistan, up and over a pass through the snowy Pamir mountains, with me intoning selected verses from Flecker&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Golden Journey to Samarkand&#x201d;:<br><br>Away, for we are ready to a man! Our camels sniff the evening and are glad. Lead on, O Master of the Caravan: Lead on the Merchant-Princes of Bagdad.<br><br>Have we not Indian carpets dark as wine, Turbans and sashes, gowns and bows and veils, And broideries of intricate design, And printed hangings in enormous bales?<br><br>And we have manuscripts in peacock styles By Ali of Damascus; we have swords Engraved with storks and apes and crocodiles, And heavy beaten necklaces, for Lords.<br><br>Sweet to ride forth at evening from the wells When shadows pass gigantic on the sand, And softly through the silence beat the bells Along the Golden Road to Samarkand . . .<br><br>. . . and then we would suddenly hit a pothole with a crash. For the road was long and, in reality, far from golden&#x2014;two hundred miles or so of cracked grey concrete slabs, each junction making our vehicle lurch violently enough to lift our stomachs into our mouths, the shoulder occasionally adorned with the burnt-out wreck of a truck lying on its side or even upside down. But arriving in Samarkand made the effort worth while. Here we were in one of the world&#x2019;s dream cities. Dusty, hot and tired, we stood in the central square and marvelled. It is said of the Taj Mahal that, however familiar the photograph, the reality is more breathtaking than one can possibly expect. So it is with Samarkand.<br><br>The Registan, the &#x201c;place of sand,&#x201d; is one of the architectural wonders of the world. On the west end of a great plaza, where six radial roads, one from each of the ancient city gates, met in the hub of his capital, Khan Ulugh Beg, famed astronomer and grandson of the Mongol ruler Timur-i-leng, Timur the Lame or Tamerlaine, no stately pleasure dome decreed, but a jewel of a madraseh&#x2014;an Islamic college. Its rectangular fa�ade, pierced by a pointed entrance arch and flanked by stubby minarets like cannon tipped on end to fire prayers at heaven, glitters with sumptuous knotwork decoration, executed in brilliant shades of blue against a background the colour of pale sand, matching the Central Asian sky and the dusty earth. While far off in the West a fifteenth-century barbarian called Henry V of England was fighting the Battle of Agincourt, here, it is said, the noble and wise Khan himself gave classes in mathematics, astronomy and philosophy. A century later, Babur, founder of the Moghul Empire, mounted his command and control post for the defence of the city on the madraseh&#x2019;s roof.<br><br>Another hundred years on, the city governor&#x2014;the resoundingly named General Alchin Yalangtush Bahadur&#x2014;commanded the building of a further matching pair of colleges, one on the north and another on the east side of the stone-paved square. Now, though, the decoration was to be different. In the two hundred years which separated the first madraseh from its fellows, the ruling style had moved on. On the central building, which doubles as both madraseh and mosque, leaf and flower shapes in green and yellow are entwined into the crystalline geometry of its mosaic tilework. But it is the third madraseh, the Sher-dar, that catches the eye unawares. For above the entrance is what must be among the most extraordinary designs to be found on any Muslim religious building anywhere.<br><br>Sher-dar is Persian for &#x201c;tiger-bearing.&#x201d; Over the grand archway through which the students would pass from blazing sunlight into the cool, dim, quiet interior, are depicted a symmetrical pair of tigers pursuing deer across a flower-strewn field. Over the back of each tiger rises an anthropomorphic sun, golden rays of light streaming out around a patently Mongol face. How astonishing on a building dedicated to educating the clergy of a religion which abhors the depiction of any living thing! The vision certainly perplexed our Pakistan-born Muslim anthropologist, the presenter of the series of films about Islam which had brought us and our television crew to Samarkand.<br><br>Standing in the middle of the square in trainers and trademark navy-blue shalwar-kamiz, Pakistani national dress, a short stocky figure dwarfed by the magnificence all around, he looked up at the images outraged and nonplussed, his piety affronted. How could decoration like this be applied to a madraseh of all places? Such pictures are strictly forbidden by Islamic law. It must be an error of some kind. Our local minder explained that the buildings had been restored in the 1920s and then again in the 1950s. Well then, the tigers and faces must have been added by the Soviet-era restorers: communist atheists who knew little and cared less about the principles of Islam; perhaps it was even done on purpose, to desecrate the sanctity of the architecture.<br><br>I was surprised that a man claiming the title Professor and nursing aspirations for high diplomatic office didn&#x2019;t recognise the device. For the sun rising over the back of a lion was the familiar symbol of both the nineteenth-century Qajar and the twentieth-century Pahlavi dynasties of Iran&#x2014;not to mention the Mojahedin-e-Khalq terrorists of today. This version, with tigers for lions and faces on the suns, could only be an earlier expression of the same motif.<br><br>The images are certainly as old as the Sher-dar madraseh itself, the work of a certain Muhammad Abbas, whose signature peeps discreetly through the tilework tendrils, and whose praises are sung in the self-congratulatory dedication executed in stylised Arabic script around the archway. &#x201c;The sky bit its finger in amazement,&#x201d; gushes the building of itself after a great deal more in the same vein, &#x201c;thinking there was a new moon.&#x201d;<br><br>What the design actually means is another matter. Muslims and scholars disagree. Locals guess that the tiger and deer motif refer to the king&#x2019;s pursuit of his enemies or perhaps to some Samarkandi legend. The orthodox interpretation is that the tiger stands for a lion, a reference to the Caliph &#x2018;Ali, the &#x201c;Lion of Islam&#x201d;&#x2014;the Prophet Muhammad&#x2019;s son-in-law and, in Shi&#x2018;ite eyes, his only rightful successor&#x2014;while the sun stands for the light of Islam.<br><br>But the sun-rayed face, seen on other buildings in the region too, actually belongs to another and older tradition than Islam. For the ever-rising and unconquered sun was always one of the symbols of Mithra, in Zoroastrian belief the intermediary between God and humanity, guarantor of contracts and fair dealing, who bestows the light of his grace on the lawful ruler. Tradition led Iranian kings and emperors down the ages to see themselves as Mithra&#x2019;s representatives on earth. In this tiger-and-sun design, the governor was glorifying his feudal master with the mandate of heaven. The Sher-dar madraseh is yet another sign that Islam in the Iranian world is like a woman&#x2019;s plain chador worn over party finery, a cloak that covers, disguises, or incorporates much traditionally Iranian, pre-Islamic, Zoroastrian belief. This time, General Alchin Yalangtush Bahadur had let the veil slip and revealed his real religious underwear.<br><br>To this day tiles decorated with elegant sun-rayed Mithra faces, not Mongolian now but Aryan, are on sale in Iranian markets. Ask what they represent and you will likely be told, as I was: &#x201c;Just a face.&#x201d;<br><br>My two earlier journeys to the East had led me to stumble many times across the traces of the Persian prophet and the religious ideas developed by his later followers. Often dismissed by pious Muslims as mere folklore, or falsely condemned as foreign influence, or even blankly denied even in the face of overwhelming evidence, the traces of Zarathustra&#x2019;s teachings refuse to fade away. In spite of everything, Zarathustra lives.<br><br>Before travelling south to the Pamirs as the Soviet Union sulkily retreated into history&#x2014;this was the beginning of the 1990s&#x2014;we had spent time in Moscow, talking to experts on the region, acclimatising ourselves to both the culture of Central Asia and, as we quickly discovered, its climate. Moscow apartments in winter must be among some of the hottest places in the world; the Soviet high-rise housing blocks that line the Prospekts, the great grim thoroughfares leading out from the city centre through the suburbs, all stained cement and peeling plaster, don&#x2019;t allow you to adjust the savage central heating. But sitting sweating in shirtsleeves seemed an appropriate way to learn about life in the desert cities of the Soviet deep south; to hear Dr. Lazar Rempel, octogenarian Jewish architect and historian, give an outsider&#x2019;s view of Central Asia as he reminisced about his fifty-six years of exile in Bokhara and Samarkand.<br><br>Dr. Rempel&#x2019;s fate was not unusual in Stalin&#x2019;s USSR. Many of those unlucky enough to attract the attention of the Father of the International Proletariat found themselves expelled from home and condemned to live thousands of miles away, among people with a different language and a different culture. Most went back as soon as they could. My own uncle in Prague had been in the Czech army before the war and had led a band of Partisans into the Bohemian forest during the Nazi occupation. In 1946 he and his men were absorbed into the Red Army and sent to the steppelands of Soviet Kazakhstan, ostensibly to help guard a &#x201c;disinfection station&#x201d; to which victims of smallpox and other epidemic diseases were spirited away. One day a convoy of trucks arrived. Soldiers jumped out and began unloading bale upon bale of barbed wire.<br><br>&#x201c;It seemed to me,&#x201d; my uncle told me long afterwards, &#x201c;that when barbed wire starts going up, no good ever comes of it.&#x201d; So he ran away, to become, years later, a stalwart of the Czechoslovak military establishment.<br>...</p><h2>Regression Therapy a Handbook for Professionals (2 Volume Set)</h2><p>This literary masterpiece is a collection of several well known regression therapists who share their clinical insights into the field of Regression Therapy.

Shafts reach skyscraper-depths, caverns are stadium-sized, and sudden floods can drown divers in an instant. With a two-decade obsession, William Stone and his 44-member team entered the sinkhole at Sotano de San Augustin. The first camp settled 2,328 feet below ground in a cavern where headlamps couldn&#39;t even illuminate the walls and ceiling. The second camp teetered precariously above an underground canyon where two subterranean rivers collided. But beyond that lay the unknown territory -- a flooded corridor that had blocked all previous comers, claimed a diver&#39;s life, and drove the rest of the team back. Except for William Stone and Barbara am Ende, who forged on for 18 more days, with no hope of rescue, to set the record for the deepest cave dive in the Western Hemisphere.</p><p>BILL STONE is the world&#39;s most accomplished caver invented the Cis-Lunar rebreather enabling cave divers to stay underwater for up to 24 hrs. BARBARA AM ENDE has a Ph.D in geology and is a member of the National Speleological Society.Set in stygian gloom, this account of a 1994 caving expedition in southern Mexico produces what adventure readers crave: danger, dissension, death, and ultimate success. Led by author Stone, the spelunkers sought the furthest reaches of a cave system, the Sistema Huautla, which plunged a kilometer and a half down and stretched out for tens of kilometers. To go the deepest, the coveted "booty" in the caving community, Stone developed a special "rebreathing" apparatus for swimming through submerged passages called sumps. As the saga unfolds (dramatically assisted by admittedly reconstructed dialogue), the riskiness of the enterprise becomes apparent as the cavers survive various snafus, which rattle some group members who come to resent Stone's hard-charging style. A cheerful wisecracker named Ian Rolland is not daunted--but soon pays the final price for this adventure. After much acrimony about whether to continue, Stone and his then-girlfriend press on, their course marked by helpful diagrams of their progress. The technicalities of this death-defying recreation, and the raw honesty with which this episode is depicted, will win over extreme-sport fans. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

But it's also a sly piece of social commentary. As King said in 1983, "In <i>'Salem's Lot</i>, the thing that really scared me was not vampires, but the town in the daytime, the town that was empty, knowing that there were things in closets, that there were people tucked under beds, under the concrete pilings of all those trailers. And all the time I was writing that, the Watergate hearings were pouring out of the TV.... Howard Baker kept asking, 'What I want to know is, what did you know and when did you know it?' That line haunts me, it stays in my mind.... During that time I was thinking about secrets, things that have been hidden and were being dragged out into the light." Sounds quite a bit like the idea behind his 1998 novel of a Maine hamlet haunted by unsightly secrets, <i>Bag of Bones</i>. <i>--Fiona Webster</i></p><p>Stephen King is the author of more than fifty books, all of them worldwide bestsellers. Among his most recent are "Full Dark, No Stars; Under the Dome; Just After Sunset;" "Duma Key; Lisey s Story;" "Cell;" and the concluding novels in" "the Dark Tower saga: "Wolves of the Calla, Song of Susannah, "and "The Dark Tower."

With their own planet doomed for destruction, the Martians prepare to invade. Their weapons are ready and their aim is ruthless.<br>The war of the worlds is about to begin.</p><p>This is the granddaddy of all alien invasion stories, first published by H.G. Wells in 1898. The novel begins ominously, as the lone voice of a narrator tells readers that "No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's..." <p> Things then progress from a series of seemingly mundane reports about odd atmospheric disturbances taking place on Mars to the arrival of Martians just outside of London. At first the Martians seem laughable, hardly able to move in Earth's comparatively heavy gravity even enough to raise themselves out of the pit created when their spaceship landed. But soon the Martians reveal their true nature as death machines 100-feet tall rise up from the pit and begin laying waste to the surrounding land. Wells quickly moves the story from the countryside to the evacuation of London itself and the loss of all hope as England's military suffers defeat after defeat. With horror his narrator describes how the Martians suck the blood from living humans for sustenance, and how it's clear that man is not being conquered so much a corralled. <i>--Craig E. Engler</i></p>H.G. Wells's science fiction classic, the first novel to explore the possibilities of intelligent life from other planets, it still startling and vivid nearly after a century after its appearance, and a half-century after Orson Wells's infamous 1938 radio adaptation. The daring portrayal of aliens landing on English soil, with its themes of interplanetary imperialism, technological holocaust and chaos, is central to the career of H.G. Wells, who died at the dawn of the atomic age. The survival of mankind in the face of "vast and cool and unsympathetic" scientific powers spinning out of control was a crucial theme throughout his work.

It does when the novel is as inventive and beautiful as this one by Anthony Doerr. In fact, <em>All the Light We Cannot See</em>--while set mostly in Germany and France before and during the war--is not really a &#x201c;war novel&#x201d;. Yes, there is fear and fighting and disappearance and death, but the author&#x2019;s focus is on the interior lives of his two characters. Marie Laure is a blind 14-year-old French girl who flees to the countryside when her father disappears from Nazi-occupied Paris. Werner is a gadget-obsessed German orphan whose skills admit him to a brutal branch of Hitler Youth. Never mind that their paths don&#x2019;t cross until very late in the novel, this is not a book you read for plot (although there is a wonderful, mysterious subplot about a stolen gem). This is a book you read for the beauty of Doerr&#x2019;s writing-- &#x201c;Abyss in her gut, desert in her throat, Marie-Laure takes one of the cans of food...&#x201d;--and for the way he understands and cherishes the magical obsessions of childhood. Marie Laure and Werner are never quaint or twee. Instead they are powerful examples of the way average people in trying times must decide daily between morality and survival. <em>--Sara Nelson</em></p>Anthony Doerr is the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel <i>All the Light We Cannot See</i>. He is also the author of two story collections <i>Memory Wall</i> and <i>The Shell Collector</i>, the novel <i>About Grace</i>, and the memoir <i>Four Seasons in Rome</i>. He has won four O. Henry Prizes, the Rome Prize, the New York Public Library&#x2019;s Young Lions Award, the National Magazine Award for fiction, a Guggenheim Fellowship, and the Story Prize.

Living away from Mum and Dad for two long years, Pam was moved between four foster homes. In some she and Iris found a second family, with babies to look after, car rides and picnics, and even a pet pig. But other billets took a more sinister turn, as the adults found it easy to exploit the children in their care. Returning to Essex, things would never be the same again, and the war was far from over. Making do with rations, dodging bombs, and helping with the war effort, Pam and her family struggled to get by. In <i>Don't Forget to Write</i>, with warmth and vivid detail, Pam describes a time that was full of overwhelming hardship and devastation; yet also of kindness and humor, resilience and courage.</p><p>Pam Hobbs is an award-winning travel writer who has written for the <i>Globe and Mail </i>among other papers and magazines.War is impossible to understand for most adults, let alone a 10-year-old child, as Hobbs demonstrates in this warmhearted memoir. In June 1940, when Hobbs and her 11-year-old sister, each carrying a gas mask and clothes bag and wearing a name tag, were evacuated from their home in Essex, England, she knew war had taken over her life. To prepare for a potential invasion by Germany, the British government had organized several evacuations of children during WWII to safer locations outside of metropolitan areas. Hobbs, along with 20,000 other children, pregnant women and mothers with preschoolers, were sent to live with families in Central England. Ultimately, Hobbs lived in four households over a two-year period, but the effects of the evacuation lasted much longer. One stay was particularly troublesome: "For me, the really sad aspect of this billet was that for the first time in my life I knew what it was like to be unwanted. It founded fears of being unloved and created a lack of self-confidence that stayed with me for years." Hobbs vividly describes the rigors of a child's life during the war and the grim years following victory, including hunger, shortage of daily items including pots and pans, and making mascara from chimney soot. But she also discovered the delights of the English countryside and two loving caretakers. Hobbs's story is both enlightening and endearing. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

No one would foresee that the greatest success story to arise from these events would be the globalization of organized crime. Current estimates suggest that illegal trade accounts for nearly one-fifth of global GDP.<br><br><i>McMafia</i> is a fearless, encompassing, wholly authoritative investigation of the now proven ability of organized crime worldwide to find and service markets driven by a seemingly insatiable demand for illegal wares. Whether discussing the Russian mafia, Colombian drug cartels, or Chinese labor smugglers, Misha Glenny makes clear how organized crime feeds off the poverty of the developing world, how it exploits new technology in the forms of cybercrime and identity theft, and how both global crime and terror are fueled by an identical source: the triumphant material affluence of the West.<br><br>To trace the disparate strands of this hydra-like story, Glenny talked to police, victims, politicians, and members of the global underworld in eastern Europe, North and South America, Africa, the Middle East, China, Japan, and India. The story of organized crime&#x2019;s phenomenal, often shocking growth is truly the central political story of our time. <i>McMafia</i> will change the way we look at the world.</p><p>Amazon Significant Seven, April 2008: In <i>McMafia</i>, Misha Glenny draws the dark map that lies on the other side of Tom Friedman's bright flat world. That connected globe not only brings software coders and supply-chain outsourcers closer together; it's also opened the gates to a criminal network of unsettling vastness, complexity, and efficiency that represents a fifth of the earth's economy, trading in everything from untaxed cigarettes and the usual narcotics to human lives and nuclear material. Glenny's a Balkans expert, and he begins his story there, with the illicit--but often state-sponsored--underworld that grew out of the post-Soviet chaos, but he soon follows the contraband everywhere from Mumbai and Johannesburg to rural Colombia and the U.S. suburbs. It's not just a hodgepodge of scare clips, though: Glenny reports from the ground but follows the leads as high as they go, showing how the dark and bright sides of the flat world are more connected than we imagine. <i>--Tom Nissley</i><b>Misha Glenny</b> was educated at Bristol University in England and Charles University in Prague.

Unfortunately, the core of the book focuses on the trials and tribulations of the Bjorklund family, who are not half as interesting as Zeb and the girls. By the time Zeb and his two companions, especially the sulky and bad-tempered Manda, arrive in Blessing to give the Bjorklund family yet more problems to test their faith, readers may be wondering why a whole book was not devoted to such well-rounded and amusing characters.

Dorothy's life could only be improved if she didn't keep stumbling across the recently-and criminally-deceased.</p></p><p>JEANNE M. DAMS is an Indiana native. Her first Dorothy Martin mystery, <i>The Body in the Transept</i>, won the Agatha Award as Best First Mystery. A retired teacher, she has degrees from Perdue and Notre Dame, and lives in South Bend, Indiana.Dorothy Martin of eccentric hat fame finds another dead body in this fifth installment in Dams's successful series (Death in Lacquer Red, etc.). Sixty-something Dorothy, an American who recently married British police officer Alan Nesbitt, resides in the cathedral town of Sherebury. With Alan on business in Africa, Dorothy travels to London only to find that the young American businessman with whom she had chatted earlier has died somewhere along the trip to Victoria Station. When the death is not reported in the papers, Dorothy becomes suspicious, and with the help of Sherebury's resident computer whiz Nigel Evans, she discovers that the young man was the CEO of a rising software company. Dorothy infiltrates the company's London office as a temporary secretary and begins hunting about for the truth. Her tenure in the corporate office flushes out several suspects and coincides with another murder. Dams has always provided clever tales, and Dorothy is quickly becoming popular among mystery fans. Once again, however, there are a few blemishes in an otherwise amiable story. Dorothy's London friends, Americans Tom and Lynn Anderson, are a little too understanding; and Dorothy is yet another cloyingly spry senior citizen. Although the finale is not especially surprising, it is gratifying. (Sept.)

In the tradition of J. R. Moehringer&#x2019;s <i>The Tender Bar</i> and the classic reportage of Joseph Mitchell, here is an indelible portrait of what is quite possibly the greatest bar in the world&#x2014;and the mercurial, magnificent man behind it.</b><br><br> The first time he saw Sunny&#x2019;s Bar, in 1995, Tim Sultan was lost, thirsty for a drink, and intrigued by the single bar sign among the forlorn warehouses lining the Brooklyn waterfront. Inside, he found a dimly lit room crammed with maritime artifacts, a dozen well-seasoned drinkers, and, strangely, a projector playing a classic Martha Graham dance performance. Sultan knew he had stumbled upon someplace special. What he didn&#x2019;t know was that he had just found his new home.<br><br> Soon enough, Sultan has quit his office job to bartend full-time for Sunny Balzano, the bar&#x2019;s owner. A wild-haired Tony Bennett lookalike with a fondness for quoting Shakespeare and Samuel Beckett, Sunny is truly one of a kind. Born next to the saloon that has been in his family for one hundred years, Sunny has over the years partied with Andy Warhol, spent time in India at the feet of a guru, and painted abstract expressionist originals. But his masterpiece is the bar itself, a place where a sublime mix of artists, mobsters, honky-tonk musicians, neighborhood drunks, nuns, longshoremen, and assorted eccentrics rub elbows. Set against the backdrop of a rapidly transforming city, <i>Sunny&#x2019;s Nights</i> is a loving and singular portrait of the dream experience we&#x2019;re all searching for every time we walk into a bar, and an enchanting memoir of an unlikely and abiding friendship.<br><br> <b>Praise for <i>Sunny&#x2019;s Nights</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Fantastic . . .

He is a graduate of Kenyon College and lives in New York City, where he works as an urban gardener.1<br><br>Antonio<br><br>There is a corner turned, a direction taken. There is a door opened in everyone&#x2019;s history that they can identify as the moment life, for better or worse, took a different course. Eve bit an apple. Dante saw Beatrice. Jack met Neal. For me, that corner, that direction, that door appeared late in the winter of 1995. The place was Red Hook, Brooklyn, the hour late, the mood desolate. I had gone to the night&#x2019;s last showing of Woody Allen&#x2019;s Bullets Over Broadway and while driving home from the theater, mulling over the movie, I had half-�absentmindedly continued straight where I usually took a left, slipping beneath an overpass and entering a neighborhood I knew only by its forbidding reputation. There were no other cars and no people and long stretches of shadow between the streetlamps. I drove on. Deliberately getting lost had been a pastime of mine since early childhood. I was raised by parents who only asked that I be home before sundown. By adolescence, I had lost my bearings in Laotian rice paddies, German forests, and a West African city where the practice of naming streets had not yet been widely adopted. In college one autumn, I courted a woman by inventing a game in which one of us would close our eyes and pretend to be blind, while the other made believe they were mute, and the mute person would lead the blind one by the hand on late-�evening ambles through professors&#x2019; backyards and frosty Ohio pastures. By winter, we could have written dissertations on the merits of disorientation but we merely fell in love instead.<br><br>That Friday night in Red Hook I was twenty-�seven years old, and again I found myself taking left and right turns seemingly at random, unsure whether I was sightseeing or soul-�searching. A succession of low-�slung industrial warehouses and towering fuel tanks gave way to darkened fields and from them the silhouette of an enormous building rose up, as still and monstrous as a pyramid. Bare trees bordering the road were the only living beings in sight. More turns. The pavement soon gave way to cobblestones and I slowed the car to a walking pace. Another building, vaguely Georgian, came into view. Its doorways and arched windows were sealed with bricks giving it the look of an asylum or prison or school, irrevocably shuttered. I deciphered white letters near the top: Shipyards Corporation.<br><br>Other lone structures appeared and melted away in my headlamps. I continued straight until I could go straight no farther. I had come to another corner. Conover Street, read the sign. Ahead, behind a rusty gate, stretched a barren lot and beyond that the water of the harbor shimmered faintly. To my right stood several satellite dishes, so immense they seemed capable of beaming their messages not only to New Jersey but to new planets. To the left more signs appeared in the gloom, one profoundly weird (Animal Hair Manufacturing Company) and the other weirdly spare (Bar). I pulled over and turned off the engine. I looked up and down the cobblestone street. There was no movement, no sound. I was alone and the sense of solitude that descended on me was as absolute as that usually only found in dreams. I wavered but a few moments before getting out of my car. Where bars were concerned, my spirit of inquiry always seemed to prevail over a sense of caution. I paused at the first building. Animal Hair Manufacturing Company. What could it mean? I walked on toward the next sign. Bar. I knew of a bar called the No Name Bar but I had never seen a bar that literally had no name. I had come to a place, it seemed, where the world was returning to its most elemental properties.<br><br>I took a few more tentative steps until I stood beneath one of two faded brown awnings. In between was a simple wooden door containing three peephole windows ascending from left to right as though to accommodate lookouts of varying heights. Two more storefront windows on either side of the door emanated a faint light and in this glow I could see a wooden ship and a black-�and-�white photograph of a sailor from an earlier generation resting on a ledge inside. The picture might have been taken during the Second World War.<br><br>I considered the forlornness of the area and of the night. I had entered a lot of bars in my life and rarely with hesitation. An early bloomer of a sort, I had my first tavern beer at fourteen and I graduated high school with the inglorious honor of being voted by my classmates as the student most likely to be found not in a bar&#x2014;�that distinction went to my best friend&#x2014;�but under a bar. While I had gotten dissipation out of my system by the time I was an adult, I still knew my way around bars in the way a person raised on a farm never forgets how to cross a livestock yard. I reached forward and pulled open the door and stepped inside. Every one of the two dozen faces in the room was turned toward me. Pale faces, male faces, their attention to my entrance so complete, I might as well have burst into act I, scene 2 at the Delacorte. It was too late to turn around and exit stage left without feeling the fool. And so, I let the door softly close behind me.<br><br>In the brief time it took for my eyes to adjust to the dim light in the room, I realized that the collective gaze was directed not at me but a movie screen that hung to the left of the door. A projector hummed in the rear of the room, its beam cutting through the gloom like a locomotive headlight. On the screen, opening credits were just beginning to appear. Martha Graham. Aaron Copland. Isamu Noguchi. Soon dancers in pioneer dress were swirling in black and white. Tinny classical music played. To the right, stools lined the bar. I slid onto the third one in and swiveled toward the screen. Among the several scenarios I&#x2019;d considered moments before as I had paused on the stoop outside&#x2014;�most involving a roomful of repeat offenders as glad to see me as their parole officers&#x2014;�a collection of men quietly smoking and watching a classic of modern dance had not been one of them. Encouraged, I waved to a figure leaning back against a counter behind the bar and, in a low voice, asked for a beer.<br><br>&#x201c;How about a Rheingold?&#x201d; whispered the shadowy form.<br><br>&#x201c;Sure. Rheingold,&#x201d; I replied, and returned to the dancers.<br><br>My neighbors up and down the length of the bar and dotting the room were as absorbed by the show as an orchestra-�row audience. Following suit, I, too, let myself be drawn in to the story of newlyweds starting out life on the American frontier. Appalachian Spring, like all of Copland&#x2019;s cheery music, had always had the approximate effect on me of sour milk, but after a few minutes I decided that beer and a crude sound system improved him. Ballet, too, was made more tolerable when observed from a barstool. The pangs of torment I usually began to feel at such performances didn&#x2019;t begin to set in even as I watched for a good twenty minutes. After the screen at last went dark, a middle-�aged, bookish-�looking man with a trimmed white beard and glasses quickly began exchanging reels. Before anyone had much chance to stir, the projector started up again and we were watching a documentary on Brooklyn bakeries that was narrated with the earnestness of a middle-�school social studies film on the catacombs of Rome and appeared to have been made around the last time a general was president of the United States. As bread baked and yeast rose, seemingly in real time, I wondered a little where this night was headed. Not two hours earlier I had been sitting in an ordinary movie theater in a familiar part of town, taking in a light crime caper with a bucket of popcorn in my lap. Now I found myself in the dark of an entirely different kind of theater, one where the program seemed to have been chosen with the help of a roulette wheel. By the time the next selection, an abstract short by Stan Brakhage made with moth wings and leaves, was under way, I began to speculate whether there wasn&#x2019;t a method to the madness. Ballet, bakeries, Brakhage&#x2014;�if we remained in our seats long enough, would we eventually move on to cabalism, calligraphy, Caligula . . . <br><br>But the final movies of the night were several silent cityscapes of 1970s New York, shot, our curator explained between reels, when he was with a girl who had a peyote habit. The girl appeared several times, sitting mutely on a couch, as the camera swung from one window to another, each a framed portrait of the city skyline.<br><br>The whirring projector stopped for good and a few yellow lights were turned on. I gestured down the bar for another round. As I waited for my beer and gazed around the room, a spindly, hollow-�eyed man with a guitar in hand suddenly stood up and announced he was going to sing a song he had written in a Texas basement. His voice was resolutely unmusical and his guitar playing paid a debt to clanging radiators but the song&#x2019;s refrain would have made greater and lesser poets despair with envy: &#x201c;She&#x2019;s not a vixen, she voted for Richard Nixon.&#x201d; What a line!<br><br>I sat on the stool, twirling my now empty bottle, taking it all in.<br><br>The films. The singer. The nautical farrago that cluttered the walls and shelves. The trio of coffee urns the size of fire hydrants near the front door, the Blatz Beer boiled-�egg dispenser, the plaster mannequins of stars of the silver screen&#x2014;�Bogart, Fields, Durante, Marx (Groucho), West, Marx (Harpo)&#x2014;�mingling in various corners. The bar counter was charred in places where cigarettes had been stubbed out. A painting of a horse hung on one wall in a spot where over time just enough sunlight must have fallen to bleach the head out: a headless horse in a nameless bar. A hook, which looked as though it once served as someone&#x2019;s prosthetic hand, dangled from a chain of Christmas lights. And high above the bar sat several model ships in glass cases. There were no pinball chimes, no televisions turned to hockey, no machines at all (other than the projector and the stereo tucked somewhere behind the counter on which Julie London was now singing). The letters Avenue P pointed the way to the bathroom, but there was no signage that would give away the year or the decade we were in. Only the clothes of the customers revealed the era, and then only fitfully. The bar looked old and worn but not in the overly careful manner of certain New York saloons where amber beer seems to take on a whole new meaning.<br><br>My eyes came to rest on the barkeep. He was laughing, chatting, smoking as he made his way along his side of the bar with my next Rheingold. From a distance, he looked vaguely Native American, like Chief Dan George of Little Big Man fame. But he also resembled Tony Bennett, if Tony Bennett had last seen a barber in 1957. Up close, I decided that if one took Tiny Tim&#x2019;s hair and put it on Gertrude Stein&#x2019;s face, one would get a very good likeness of this man. From what little I had heard of his voice, he sounded kind of Irish, but when my beer arrived and I introduced myself, he said, &#x201c;My real name is Antonio. Antonio Raffaele Balzano. But please. Call me Sunny.&#x201d; He gripped my hand in both of his and leaned across the bar.<br><br>He was tall and very slim but the features on his face were large and rounded as a ship&#x2019;s weathered figurehead. His eyebrows were two silver caterpillars that had come to a halt while walking Indian file across his brow. His fingers were as thick as a stout woman&#x2019;s wrists. In the shadows, he had appeared a little otherworldly and a little epicene&#x2014;�less the ghost of the Ancient Mariner than that of the Mariner&#x2019;s sister. But now he grasped my hand with the vigor and enthusiasm and curiosity of a man coming upon a compatriot after months lost in the jungle. It was a greeting startling in its sincerity and intensity, and one that I would come to see made to others many times. It expressed: &#x201c;You belong.&#x201d; To say that he exuded charisma would be like saying Mussolini liked to hear himself talk.<br><br>Antonio&#x2014;�Sunny&#x2014;�eventually continued on, stopping to speak with each person or party seated at the bar. I watched him and I watched how everyone else kept an eye on him, as if awaiting a turn to be in his company. He kept a cigarette continuously lit and often tilted his head back to blow plumes of smoke in the air. He sipped whiskey out of shot glasses that looked like thimbles in his hands while telling stories about rats he had slain at various times in his life. Though I only heard snatches, I assumed he meant the kind with whiskers and tails. He recited several lines of what I took to be Shakespeare. He pronounced words in a way I had never heard before. He might say, &#x201c;I ate a plate of ersters and then I slipped on some erl on my way to the terlet.&#x201d; He used strange words rarely heard in casual conversation, like &#x201c;verbiage&#x201d; and &#x201c;personage.&#x201d; And he used words strangely, saying for instance, &#x201c;Within the framework that it is that it is that we&#x2019;re existing in.&#x201d;<br><br>I was certain that I had never encountered a more arresting presence.<br><br>I stayed awhile longer in the hope Sunny would come back over to where I was sitting but he was so deeply engrossed in conversation that eventually, I put my jacket and cap on and slipped out the door as quietly as I had come in, knowing I would be back.<br><br>But the next time I returned&#x2014;�and the one or two times after that&#x2014;�I found the bar dark, the door locked, the street deserted. I cupped my face against the window and peered into the inkiness inside, but there was no sign of Sunny, of the projector&#x2019;s flicker, or of any of the drinking, smoking men who had been there that first night. The sailor in the photograph in the window was the only witness who could corroborate that the night had taken place at all.<br><br>Months passed, until one evening in September I was returning from a quiet dinner with a onetime flame in Manhattan and feeling that restive curiosity again. I decided to give Sunny and his bar one more try. I slowly drove down his block and as I passed the two shabby awnings, I thought I could detect a glow coming from inside. I parked by the Animal Hair Manufacturing Company. I walked to the front door and I saw that the colored Christmas lights strung up behind the bar were lit again and I entered and sat at the same spot, three rickety barstools in. Many of the same faces were there. When Sunny saw me, he strolled over, cried, &#x201c;Timmy! How are you, my buddy?&#x201d; and leaned across the bar to embrace me.<br><br>&#x201c;You remember my name?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course I do. How could I not?&#x201d;<br><br>And so our friendship began.</p><h2>Sewing Specialty Fabrics (Singer Sewing Reference Library)</h2><p>Shows how to work with laces, corduroys, velvets, plaids, knits, vinyls, leathers, and synthetic furs, and gives advice on laying out, marking, cutting, and pressing specialty fabrics</p><p></p><h2>The Sabbath: Its Meaning for the Modern Man (Shambhala Library)</h2><p>Elegant, passionate, and filled with the love of God's creation, Abraham Hoshua Heschel's <i>The Sabbath </i> has been hailed as a classic of Jewish spirituality ever since its original publication in 1951&#x2014;and has been read by thousands of people of many faiths seeking meaning in modern life. In this brief yet profound meditation on the meaning of the Seventh Day, Heschel introduced the enormously influential idea of an "architecture of holiness" that appears not in space but in time. Judaism, he argues, is the religion of time: it finds meaning not in space and the material things that fill it but in time and the eternity that imbues it, so that "the Sabbaths are our great cathedrals."</p><p>Abraham Joshua Heschel (1907&#x2013;1972) <i> </i>was a well-known scholar, author, activist, and theologian. He was Professor of Ethics and Mysticism at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York City.<b>The Sabbath</b><br><i><b>Part One</b></i><b>I</b><b><i>A Palace in Time</i></b>He who wants to enter the holiness of the day must first lay down the profanity of clattering commerce, of being yoked to toil. He must go away from the screech of dissonant days, from the nervousness and fury of acquisitiveness and the betrayal in embezzling his own life. He must say farewell to manual work and learn to understand that the world has already been created and will survive without the help of man. Six days a week we wrestle with the world, wringing profit from the earth; on the Sabbath we especially care for the seed of eternity planted in the soul. The world has our hands, but our soul belongs to Someone Else. Six days a week we seek to dominate the world, on the seventh day we try to dominate the self.When the Romans met the Jews and noticed their strict adherence to the law of abstaining from labor on the Sabbath, their only reaction was contempt. The Sabbath is a sign of Jewish indolence, was the opinion held by Juvenal, Seneca and others.In defense of the Sabbath, Philo, the spokesman of the Greek-speaking Jews of Alexandria, says: "On this day we are commanded to abstain from all work, not because the law inculcates slackness ... . Its object is rather to give man relaxation from continuous and unending toil and by refreshing their bodies with a regularly calculated system of remissions to sendthem out renewed to their old activities. For a breathing spell enables not merely ordinary people but athletes also to collect their strength with a stronger force behind them to undertake promptly and patiently each of the tasks set before them." 1Here the Sabbath is represented not in the spirit of the Bible but in the spirit of Aristotle. According to the Stagirite, "we need relaxation, because we cannot work continuously. Relaxation, then, is not an end"; it is "for the sake of activity," for the sake of gaining strength for new efforts.2 To the biblical mind, however, labor is the means toward an end, and the Sabbath as a day of rest, as a day of abstaining from toil, is not for the purpose of recovering one's lost strength and becoming fit for the forthcoming labor. The Sabbath is a day for the sake of life. Man is not a beast of burden, and the Sabbath is not for the purpose of enhancing the efficiency of his work. "Last in creation, first in intention," 3 the Sabbath is "the end of the creation of heaven and earth:" 4The Sabbath is not for the sake of the weekdays; the weekdays are for the sake of Sabbath.5 It is not an interlude but the climax of living.Three acts of God denoted the seventh day: He rested, He blessed and He hallowed the seventh day (Genesis 2:2-3). To the prohibition of labor is, therefore, added the blessing of delight and the accent of sanctity. Not only the hands of man celebrate the day, the tongue and the soul keep the Sabbath. One does not talk on it in the same manner in which one talks on weekdays. Even thinking of business or labor should be avoided.Labor is a craft, but perfect rest is an art. It is the result of an accord of body, mind and imagination. To attain a degree of excellence in art, one must accept its discipline, one must adjure slothfulness. The seventhday is a <i>palace in time</i> which we build. It is made of soul, of joy and reticence. In its atmosphere, a discipline is a reminder of adjacency to eternity. Indeed, the splendor of the day is expressed in terms of <i>abstentions,</i> just as the mystery of God is more adequately conveyed <i>via negationis,</i> in the categories of <i>negative theology</i> which claims that we can never say what He is, we can only say what He is not. We often feel how poor the edifice would be were it built exclusively of our rituals and deeds which are so awkward and often so obtrusive. How else express glory in the presence of eternity, if not by the silence of abstaining from noisy acts? These restrictions utter songs to those who know how to stay at a palace with a queen.&nbsp;<br>There is a word that is seldom said, a word for an emotion almost too deep to be expressed: the love of the Sabbath. The word is rarely found in our literature, yet for more than two thousand years the emotion filled our songs and moods. It was as if a whole people were in love with the seventh day. Much of its spirit can only be understood as an example of love carried to the extreme. As in the chivalric poetry of the Middle Ages, the "underlying principle was that love should always be absolute, and that the lover's every thought and act should on all occasions correspond with the most extreme feelings or sentiments or fancies possible for a lover.""Love, with the troubadours and their ladies, was a source of joy. Its commands and exigencies made life's supreme law. Love was knighthood's service; it was loyalty and devotion; it was the noblest human giving. It was also the spring of excellence, the inspiration of high deeds." 6 Chivalric culture created a romantic conception of adoration and love that to this day dominates in its combination of myth and passion the literatureand mind of Western man. The Jewish contribution to the idea of love is the conception of love of the Sabbath, the love of a day, of spirit in the form of time.What is so luminous about a day? What is so precious to captivate the hearts? It is because the seventh day is a mine where spirit's precious metal can be found with which to construct the palace in time, a dimension in which the human is at home with the divine; a dimension in which man aspires to approach the likeness of the divine.For where shall the likeness of God be found? There is no quality that space has in common with the essence of God. There is not enough freedom on the top of the mountain; there is not enough glory in the silence of the sea. Yet the likeness of God can be found in time, which is eternity in disguise.The art of keeping the seventh day is the art of painting on the canvas of time the mysterious grandeur of the climax of creation: as He sanctified the seventh day, so shall we. The love of the Sabbath is the love of man for what he and God have in common. Our keeping the Sabbath day is a paraphrase of His sanctification of the seventh day.What would be a world without Sabbath? It would be a world that knew only itself or God distorted as a thing or the abyss separating Him from the world; a world without the vision of a window in eternity that opens into time.&nbsp;<br>For all the idealization, there is no danger of the idea of the Sabbath becoming a fairy-tale. With all the romantic idealization, the Sabbath remains a concrete fact, a legal institution and a social order. There is no danger of its becoming a disembodied spirit, for the spirit of the Sabbath must always be in accord withactual deeds, with definite actions and abstentions. The real and the spiritual are one, like body and soul in a living man. It is for the law to clear the path; it is for the soul to sense the spirit.This is what the ancient rabbis felt: the Sabbath demands all of man's attention, the service and singleminded devotion of total love. The logic of such a conception compelled them to enlarge constantly the system of laws and rules of observance. They sought to ennoble human nature and make it worthy of being in the presence of the royal day.Yet law and love, discipline and delight, were not always fused. In their illustrious fear of desecrating the spirit of the day, the ancient rabbis established a level of observance which is within the reach of exalted souls but not infrequently beyond the grasp of ordinary men.The glorification of the day, the insistence upon strict observance, did not, however, lead the rabbis to a deification of the law. "The Sabbath is given unto you, not you unto the Sabbath."7 The ancient rabbis knew that excessive piety may endanger the fulfilment of the essence of the law.8 "There is nothing more important, according to the Torah, than to preserve human life ... Even when there is the slightest possibility that a life may be at stake one may disregard every prohibition of the law."9 One must sacrifice mitzvot <i>for the sake of man</i> rather than sacrifice man <i>"for the sake of mitzvot."</i> The purpose of the Torah is "to bring life to Israel, in this world and in the world to come." 10Continuous austerity may severely dampen, yet levity would certainly obliterate the spirit of the day. One cannot modify a precious filigree with a spear or operate on a brain with a plowshare. It must always be remembered that the Sabbath is not an occasion fordiversion or frivolity; not a day to shoot fireworks or to turn somersaults, but an opportunity to mend our tattered lives; to collect rather than to dissipate time. Labor without dignity is the cause of misery; rest without spirit the source of depravity. Indeed, the prohibitions have succeeded in preventing the vulgarization of the grandeur of the day.Two things the people of Rome anxiously desired--bread and circus games.11 But man does not live by bread and circus games alone. Who will teach him how to desire anxiously the spirit of a sacred day?The Sabbath is the most precious present mankind has received from the treasure house of God. All week we think: The spirit is too far away, and we succumb to spiritual absenteeism, or at best we pray: Send us a little of Thy spirit. On the Sabbath the spirit stands and pleads: Accept all excellence from me ...Yet what the spirit offers is often too august for our trivial minds. We accept the ease and relief and miss the inspirations of the day, where it comes from and what it stands for. This is why we pray for understanding :&nbsp;<br>May Thy children realize and understand that their rest comes from Thee, and that to rest means to sanctify Thy name.12&nbsp;<br>To observe the Sabbath is to cele...</p><h2>The Creation (A Studio book)</h2><p>THE STORY OF CREATION HAS INSPIRED POETRY, PAINTING AND MUSIC THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES; IN THESE PAGES IT ISTOLD FOR THE FIRST TIME IN PHOTOGRAPHS, OFFERING &#39;A SORT OF SPIRITUALECOLOGY IN PRAISE OF THE EARTH WHICHMAN INHERITED AND SHOULD SEEK ARDENTLY TO PERFECT&#39;.

And this is no flight of editorial fantasy. Goodall always accorded these members of her "darlingest family" their proper place alongside such correspondents as her mother, her father, her best friend, and her mentor, Louis Leakey (a.k.a. FFF, Foster Fairy Father). <i>Africa in My Blood</i> opens with 7-year-old Valerie Jane's encounters with various canines (real and porcelain) as well as signs of incipient naturalism--she has found "a ded rook he died of cold" and is caretaking a "catepiler." In the same communiqu�, she also notes that her toy chimp has a new dress. Goodall would later prefer her primates au naturel but would continue to balance her urge for living taxonomy with love and empathy.<p> Culled from more than 16,000 letters, this collection will inspire Goodall adepts and those coming upon her for the first time. Her "autobiography in letters" restores this icon to full, even frivolous, humanity. It also recalls a lost era of inspired amateurism. When she went off to Nairobi at 23 in the spring of 1957, Goodall had no formal scientific training. Yet within weeks she had met Leakey and was soon working with him, not to mention rebuffing his advances, though she assures her mother that "he's much too fond of me for any monkey business." </p><p> Meanwhile, they had already discussed monkey business of a higher sort. "There is the vaguest possible chance that little me," Goodall wrote, "<i>may</i> have the chance to go right out into the wilds of the Northern Frontier for two or 3 months to study a strange tribe of chimpanzees who may be a new species, or sub-species. That is too heavenly to even think about." By the summer of 1960, Goodall was installed at the Gombe Stream Chimpanzee Reserve (which she soon termed Chimpland). And over the next year, she made four key discoveries, if not more, and was proving herself the zoological equal of such masters as George Schaller, having documented her subjects eating meat as well as using tools with ease. </p><p> <i>Africa in My Blood</i> reminds us that Goodall was once a controversial rather than hallowed figure, her methodology viewed with suspicion and condescension. And as many of us happily vegetate in front of televised slices of animal life, her awareness of her privileged position puts things in perspective. In early 1961, Goodall recounts a complex ritual and then asks her family: "Can you begin to imagine how I felt? The only human ever to have witnessed such a display, in all its primitive, fantastic wonder?"</p><p> Because Goodall has written so elegantly and incisively on chimpanzee behavior in, for instance, <i>In the Shadow of Man</i> and <i>Through a Window</i>, some readers might initially be tempted to gloss over her descriptions of such animals as the venerable David Greybeard and expert towel thief William and concentrate on her own persona--teasing, hyper-enthusiastic, and absolutely determined. When her project is threatened in 1963, she implores FFF: "You would fall head over heels in love with all my darlings--never, never think that I will let anything happen to them through what I am doing. I KNOW it is right. I KNOW that I can work the Reserve the way it must. I KNOW that I shall come back here time and time again until the problems that remain are hardly worth mentioning." <i>Africa in My Blood</i> makes it clear that, as Jane Goodall has long stressed, human and ape cannot be separated. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>Jane Goodall's research at Gombe is entering is fifth decade.

Schiff argues that America is enjoying a government-inflated bubble, one that reality will explode . . . with disastrous consequences for the economy and for each of us. Schiff demonstrates how the infusion of billions of dollars of stimulus money has only dug a deeper hole: the United States government simply spends too much and does not collect enough money to pay its debts, and in the end, Americans from all walks of life will face a crushing consequence. </p><p>We're in hock to China, we can't afford the homes we own, and the entire premise of our currency---backed by the full faith and credit of the United States---is false. Our system is broken, Schiff says, and there are only two paths forward. The one we're on now leads to a currency and sovereign debt crisis that will utterly destroy our economy and impoverish the vast majority of our citizens. </p><p>However, if we change course, the road ahead will be a bit rockier at first, but the final destination will be far more appealing. If we want to avoid complete collapse, we must drastically reduce government spending---eliminate entire agencies, end costly foreign military escapades and focus only on national defense---and stop student loan or mortgage interest deductions, as well as drug wars and bank-and-business bailouts. We must also do what no politician or pundit has proposed: America should declare bankruptcy, restructure its debts, and reform our system from the ground up. </p><p>Persuasively argued and provocative, <i>The Real Crash</i> explains how we got into this mess, how we might get out of it, and what happens if we don't. And, with wisdom born from having predicted the Crash of 2008, Peter Schiff explains how to protect yourself, your family, your money, and your country against what he predicts.</p></p><p><p>PETER D. SCHIFF is an American investment broker, author, and financial commentator, and was a candidate in the 2010 Republican primary for the United States Senate seat from Connecticut.

Once that bubble burst and major banks went to the brink of failure, people began crediting me with &#x201c;calling the crash.&#x201d; But what we saw in 2008 and 2009 wasn&#x2019;t the crash. That was the overture. Now we have to sit through the opera.<br>The economic unpleasantness of those days was definitely <i>part</i> of the real crash, but only because of the way our politicians responded&#x2014;replacing one government-created bubble with another, thus putting our economy at even greater risk.<br>The same bubble machine that fueled the last two boom-bust cycles&#x2014;the Federal Reserve&#x2014;is already back in high gear, and we must turn it off. The Fed needs to stop fueling inflation and start sucking dollars back out of the economy. It also needs to let interest rates rise. When the Fed does these two things, Washington&#x2019;s free ride will end&#x2014;it will no longer be able to borrow at near zero interest. As a result, Congress will have to slash spending, fix our entitlements, and generally shrink government.<br>These are the right things to do today&#x2014;they were the right things to do ten years ago. But soon they will become inevitable. We will have no choice.<br>My past books predicted the crash. This book goes a step further and lays out the steps we need to take in order to make this crash as painless as possible and to rebuild in the aftermath. We need to wind down entitlements, eliminate many government functions, and stop playing with the money supply and interest rates. America needs to start making things again, and the government needs to stop taking. As individuals and as a nation, we need to get out of debt.<br>And ultimately, we&#x2019;ll have to face up to the fact that we can&#x2019;t pay off all our debts.<br>The later chapters spell out the solutions, but these first two chapters describe the problem.<br>Our economy today is once again built on imaginary wealth. Like the proverbial house built on sand, it will collapse. When that happens, when America&#x2019;s tab finally comes due, it will probably be as bad, or worse, than the Great Depression. You&#x2019;d better be ready for it.<br><b>From a Dot-Com Bubble to a Housing Bubble to a Government Bubble</b><br>To understand how bad things are and where we&#x2019;re headed, let&#x2019;s quickly go back a decade or so, and retrace the steps that brought us here.<br>Throughout the 1990s, the Federal Reserve injected tons of money into the economy, which fueled a stock bubble, focused particularly on dot-com companies. In 2000 and 2001, when the stock market turned down and unemployment started to creep up, that was a correction.<br>Assets that had been overvalued (such as stocks) were returning to a more appropriate price. The dot-com and stock market bubble had misallocated resources, and while investment was fleeing the overvalued sectors, inevitably the economy shrunk and unemployment rose while wealth became more rationally allocated around the economy.<br>Readjustments in the economy involve short-term pain, just as the cure to a sickness often tastes bitter. Short-term pain, however, was unacceptable to the politicians and central bankers in 2000 and 2001.<br>Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan manipulated interest rates lower. This made borrowing cheaper, inspired more businesses to invest, and softened the employment crunch. But the economy wasn&#x2019;t really getting stronger. That is, there weren&#x2019;t more businesses producing things of value. As there were few good business investments, all this cheap capital flowed into housing.<br>As housing values skyrocketed, Americans were getting richer on paper. This made it seem as if things were okay. In other words, Greenspan accomplished his goal of forestalling any significant pain. By the same token, he also kept the economy from healing properly, which would have laid the foundation for a stronger and lasting recovery.<br>When market realities started to bear down on the economy, and the housing bubble popped, with the broader credit bubble right behind, the government was running out of things to artificially inflate. So the Fed and the Obama administration decided to pump money desperately into government.<br>I&#x2019;ll explore this &#x201c;how-we-got-here&#x201d; story in more depth in Chapter 2, but for now, I&#x2019;ll make this point:<br>Just as the housing bubble delayed the economic collapse for much of last decade on the strength of imaginary wealth, <i>the government</i> bubble is propping us up now. The pressure within the bubble will grow so great that the Federal Reserve will soon have only two options: (a) to finally contract the money supply and let interest rates spike&#x2014;which will cause immensely more pain than if we had let this happen back in 2002 or 2008; or (b) just keep pumping dollars into the economy, causing hyperinflation and all the evils that come with it.<br>The politically easier choice will be the latter, wiping out the dollar through hyperinflation. The grown-up choice will be the former, electing for some painful tightening&#x2014;which will also entail the federal government admitting that it cannot fulfill all the promises it has made, and it cannot repay everything it owes.<br>In either case, we&#x2019;ll get the real crash.<br><b>The National Debt</b><br>As a professional investor, when I study the American economy today, I see debilitating weaknesses. Most obvious is the debt. As this book went to press, the national debt was $17 trillion. That works out to approximately $140,000 per taxpayer. Let&#x2019;s talk a bit about what this means.<br>Whenever the government wants to spend money it doesn&#x2019;t have, it borrows. Our government borrows by selling T-bills and Treasury bonds, or &#x201c;Treasuries.&#x201d; The buyer gets an IOU, and the government gets cash. So, various bondholders&#x2014;individual investors, U.S. banks, the Chinese government, the Federal Reserve, even parts of the U.S. government&#x2014;hold in aggregate $17 trillion in IOUs. These bonds and bills come due all the time, and typically, the Treasury pays them off by borrowing again.<br>Every day, the debt grows. First, it grows because it accumulates interest. In 2010, taxpayers paid $414 billion in interest on the national debt, but that wasn&#x2019;t enough to keep the debt from growing. Another reason the debt keeps growing: our government keeps borrowing more in order to spend more.<br>Barack Obama&#x2019;s $800 billion stimulus in 2009, for instance, was entirely funded by borrowing. In Fiscal Year 2011, the U.S. Government spent $3.6 trillion, but brought in only $2.3 trillion in revenues. The extra $1.3 trillion&#x2014;the budget deficit for the year&#x2014;was paid for through borrowing.<br>As a businessman or the head of a household, if you spend more than you earn in a given month, you&#x2019;re doing one of two things: you&#x2019;re either spending down your savings, or leaving a balance on your credit card. But the federal government has no net savings. That leaves only one option: every dime of deficit is added to our national debt&#x2014;plus interest.<br>State governments are in the red, too. Nearly every state ran a deficit in 2010, and the aggregate of state debt is about $1.3 trillion. Local governments owe a combined $1.8 trillion. Add that $3.1 trillion in state and local debt to Uncle Sam&#x2019;s $17 trillion, and our public debt tops $20 trillion. Much worse, when off-budget and contingent liabilities are thrown in, total government debt tops 100 trillion!<br><b>State of Bankruptcy</b><br>In some ways, our state governments are in worse shape than the federal government. While most states don&#x2019;t have huge ticking time bombs like Medicare, they have just as much&#x2014;or more&#x2014;trouble breaking even.<br>For Fiscal Year 2012, more than forty states were in the red. Twenty-seven states (a majority of states and a vast majority of the country) were running deficits of 10 percent or more, according to data from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.<br>California is probably the most famous of the insolvent states because of the massive size of its annual shortfall: more than $25 billion in 2012.<br>To poison the fiscal waters so completely, it took a special brew of big-government liberalism, anti-tax-hike ballot measures, powerful public employee unions, and ridiculous public pension laws. These factors created what Manhattan Institute scholar Josh Barro calls &#x201c;California&#x2019;s permanent budget crisis.&#x201d;<br>Indeed, since 2005, the California state legislature has been fighting an annual &#x201c;crisis.&#x201d; Barro explains:<br>California&#x2019;s permanent budget crisis stems from institutional failures. Ballot measures have made it nearly impossible to raise taxes or cut spending, and have cemented the idea in voters&#x2019; minds that they can get government services without paying for them. The state has repeatedly failed to reform its inefficient tax code (which relies too much on highly volatile taxes on high-income people, and not enough on property taxes) or to tackle the problem of runaway public employee compensation.<br>California is special in many regards. (For instance, no other state has city managers paying themselves nearly a million dollars a year, as the folks of Bell, California, were caught doing.) But many of the problems with California are present elsewhere.<br>One is the tendency of states to go wild during boom years in revenue. Many individuals who did well during the boom years bought McMansions with huge mortgages on the assumption that every year would be just as good. Many states did the same thing. Nevada is a classic example. Nevada enjoyed faster population growth than any other state in the 1990s and most of the 2000s. This coincided with the nationwide housing bubble, and sent home prices through th...</p><h2>A Covert Life: Jay Lovestone: Communist, Anti-Communist, and Spymaster</h2><p>The extraordinary life of Jay Lovestone is one of the great untold stories of the twentieth century. A Lithuanian immigrant who came to the United States in 1897, Lovestone rose to leadership in the Communist Party of America, only to fall out with Moscow and join the anti-Communist establishment after the Second World War. He became one of the leading strategists of the Cold War, and was once described as "one of the five most important men in the hidden power structure of America." <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Lovestone was obsessively secretive, and it is only with the opening of his papers at the Hoover Institution, the freeing of access to Comintern files in Moscow, and the release of his 5,700-page FBI file that biographer and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Ted Morgan has been able to construct a full account of the remarkable events of Jay Lovestone's life. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>The life Morgan describes is full of drama and intrigue. He recounts Lovestone's career in the faction-riven world of American Communism until he was spirited out of Moscow in 1929 after Stalin publicly attacked him for doctrinal unorthodoxy. As Lovestone veered away from Moscow, he came to work for the American Federation of Labor, managing a separate union foreign policy as well as maintaining his own intelligence operations for the CIA, many under the command of the legendary counterintelligence chief James Angleton. Lovestone also associated with Louise Page Morris, a spy known as "the American Mata Hari," who helped him undermine Communist advances in the developing world and whose own significant espionage career is detailed here. Lovestone's influence, always exercised from behind the scenes, survived to the end of the Cold War and the demise of the Soviet Union.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>A Covert Life</b> has all the elements of a classic spy thriller: surveillance operations and stings, love affairs and bungled acts of sabotage, many thoroughly illegal. It is written with the easy hand of a fine biographer (The Washington Post Book World called Ted Morgan "a master storyteller") and provides a history of the Cold War and a glimpse into the machinery of the CIA while also revealing many hitherto hidden details of the superpower confrontation that dominated postwar global politics.</p><p><i>A Covert Life</i> tersely chronicles the life of one of the more obscure warriors of the cold war. Jay Lovestone, born Jacob Liebstein, cut his teeth as a youth in the leftist street culture of New York's Lower East Side. Although present at the formation of the U.S. Communist Party in 1919, he was forced out of the Comintern in 1929 by Stalin's political maneuverings. By the end of the Depression, Lovestone broke cleanly with the Soviets and, after World War II, founded the Free Trade Union Commission, an AFL-backed movement that organized noncommunist labor unions outside of the United States. He also developed an intelligence-gathering unit within the organization that traded information with the CIA until the mid-1960s.<p> Lovestone lived a fairly reclusive life, shunning the spotlight that some of his more colorful colleagues and coconspirators, such as James Jesus Angleton and George Meany, craved. As a result, Ted Morgan's biography emphasizes Lovestone's political fights both within the Communist Party and against it. Although Morgan believes that his subject's anticommunist beliefs were genuine, one finishes <i>A Covert Life</i> with the conclusion that Lovestone's motivations lay in his obsessive love of political intrigue rather than the ideological passions that moved both the far left and extreme right for much of the 20th century. While the book doesn't dwell in what Vivian Gornick called "the romance of American communism," it does present a precise portrait of how this ideology was stifled and how the American labor movement aided the intelligence community in combating Soviet influence over international labor. <i>--John M. Anderson</i></p><br>Praise for A Covert Life<br> <br>A major contribution to the history of the Cold War and a terrific tale of intrigue, intellectual passion, and betrayal.

Baltimore gestures to the men picking their way through the darkness behind him, then moves in a crouch toward a small rise that could be a mound of war-torn earth...or a hill of corpses. <br><br>He falls to one knee behind the mound, which is indeed an innocent pile of dirt, excavated in the process of digging a trench. But Baltimore feels no relief at the discovery, save that the small mound provides better cover than corpses would have. Bullets pass through putrefying flesh far easier than through hard earth. <br><br>In the thick of the night, only a madman would attempt to cross the ravaged No Man&#x2019;s Land that separates his battalion from the Hessians. The blasted tundra is furrowed with dank, muddy trenches and strewn with the bodies of the dead. Bales of barbed wire are stretched in winding serpents across the field. <br><br>Yet madmen they are. The battalion commander has determined that someone must traverse that damned earth in the dark and bring the fight to the enemy. Desperation demands it. Without some twist of fate&#x2013;brought by gods or men&#x2013;the dawn will find them in circumstances most dire. <br><br>The mission has gone to Captain Baltimore. <br><br>He has led his platoon away from the safety of the battalion camp, out of the forest that now seems so far behind them, and fifty yards into No Man's Land. Ahead lies at least four times that distance before they will reach any <br>decent cover. The Hessians are camped in thick woods on the other side of the battlefield. <br><br>Baltimore knows that he stands at the very edge of the world. How else to explain the dread that slithers in the hollow of his chest and wraps itself around his soul? He must be on the threshold of Hell, for he can conceive of no patch of ground that could be farther from home and family and comfort. Yet this is the nature of war. To become a soldier, to spill blood and evict human souls in the name of faith or country, means traveling so far from home that home becomes as distant and cherished a memory as innocence. <br><br>He yearns for them both, even as he realizes at last&#x2013;only now, only here&#x2013;that they are lost to him forever. <br><br>As a boy he had kept to his room on rainy days and played with his tin soldiers, had cast them as enemies and caused them to kill one another on the battlefield of his blanket. But tin soldiers do not bleed. They go back in the box and live to fight another day. <br><br>Soldiers of flesh and blood also end up in a box, but theirs is of heavy pine. Baltimore has seen far too many soldiers bleed, and go into that wooden box in pieces. Dread flows in his veins now, making it difficult for him to move. Death waits for him on that ravaged ground and he has no wish to meet it. His bones ache with a chill that is more from terror and sadness than the November air, and he can scarcely breathe.<br><br>He raises a hand and signals his men, first to the left and then to the right. In two lines they hurry forward, flanking his position on both sides. Their motion is barely a whisper to disturb the darkness, yet to him they seem far too loud. As they come nearer he can hear the soft tread of boots upon hard earth and the chest-deep grunts of grim men tired of killing.<br><br>They take shape in the darkness, figures topped with the flat plate helmets of the allied forces, carrying rifles at the ready. Nearest him is Sergeant Tomlin, whose rifle lies cradled in his arms like a newborn. <br><br>The night sky is hung low with billowing clouds. Only the barest hint of light filters through from the heavens. Tomlin&#x2019;s eyes glint in the dark, and now that he is close, Baltimore sees the urgency in the man&#x2019;s features. His skin prickles with fear, and his chest aches with the pounding of his heart. Baltimore has never been a coward. Yet now he hesitates, in the worst place imaginable for such a pause. <br><br>With no other choice, he nods, raises his hand, and signals again.<br><br>Ebon shapes move out across the field. Baltimore and Sergeant Tomlin split up, go around the earthen mound, and even at that distance the sergeant exists as little more than a dark patch of moving shadow. Baltimore clutches his rifle so tightly that the grip pains him. His legs move seemingly of their own accord, carrying him across the torn-up earth. He nearly stumbles over a dead soldier, his body burnt so badly that it is impossible to tell whether he had been friend or foe. The dead man&#x2019;s face has run like melted wax. <br><br>"My God," he whispers to the night.<br><br>Tomlin scurries left to meet up with his detachment and Baltimore tears himself away from the gaze of the dead man to join up with the detachment on the right. Soft grunts and the shush of canvas and cotton uniforms can be heard up the line where Tomlin&#x2019;s group convenes, but the night has swallowed them.<br><br>In a crouch, Baltimore steals along the ruined ground, his men falling in around him. He lifts a hand, glances around for Norwich, the corporal with the wire-cutters, and finds the man right beside him, the twin handles of the tool jutting from his pack. <br><br>One by one they reach the barbed wire&#x2013;a tangled, coiled mess as tall as a man. Baltimore drops to one knee. With a gesture, he signals to Corporal Norwich. The man hands his rifle to the private beside him and slides the wire-cutters from his pack. Swiftly, and as silently as possible, Norwich sets to work on the barbed wire. Farther up the line, Tomlin&#x2019;s detachment will be doing the same. <br><br>Baltimore stands and peers at the wall of darkness on the far side of the battlefield. The trees nearest the open ground are stripes of shadow against the deeper black of the forest. <br><br>Norwich has progressed halfway through the six-foot mesh of barbed wire. Where he&#x2019;s already cut, the wire has pulled back like the flesh around a wound. <br><br>The corporal snips a wire that whips back and lashes his cheek, tearing flesh. Norwich groans loudly, drops the wire-cutters, and claps a hand to his cheek, but he does not shout or curse. Baltimore races toward the break in the barbed wire. He signals to the private holding Norwich&#x2019;s rifle and together the two men drag Norwich out of the breach by his legs. <br><br>The corporal&#x2019;s eyes are wide with pain and a seething, oddly directionless anger. Blood paints black streaks on his cheek and jaw, seeping out from the hand he presses to his wound. <br><br>Baltimore gives Norwich a nod of approval for the effort he&#x2019;s made to keep quiet. Then he gestures to the private who helped him pull Norwich out of the wire, a silent command for him to pick up the cutters and continue the job. The private hesitates a moment, as though hoping the order had been directed at some other soldier. Then, reluctantly, he crawls into the barbed wire and picks up the cutters. <br><br>A shadowy figure of grays and blacks moves nearer, emerging from the clutch of waiting soldiers. He doffs his flat plate helmet and Baltimore sees it is the medic, Stockton. The man reaches into a pouch strapped over his shoulder and pulls out a small kit. Quickly, as the skinny private snips wireafter wire, opening a path through the barbed coils, Stockton cleans Norwich&#x2019;s wound and smears a coagulant paste over it. There is nothing more to be done. The placement of the gash makes a bandage troublesome in the field.<br><br>Stockton takes one last look at the wound but in the dark it is impossible to discern any real detail. The medic gives Captain Baltimore a thumbs up and moves in a crouch to join the other soldiers awaiting the order to move out. A black silhouette in Mercury&#x2019;s helmet hands him his rifle. <br><br>The skinny private emerges from the wire, moving low. He&#x2019;s finished the job Norwich had begun. They have a path now.<br><br>Grimacing, Norwich stands and takes the cutters back, slipping them into his pack. He and the private turn an expectant look upon their captain. Baltimore nods, and signals them forward. Private Macintosh takes point. Baltimore could not have mistaken the silhouette of that giant brute for any other. The captain falls in with his men, fifth in line as they step quickly through the gap in the tangle of barbed wire. <br><br>Once they are through, they spread out, making a line along the inside of the wire. Baltimore surveys the pitted and scarred field of battle ahead. The wind kicks up. He shivers as the chill cuts through his uniform, slicing to the bone. <br><br>Less than ten feet ahead lies a trench that gapes like a wound slashed in the world. The blackness in that pit makes the night seem bright in comparison. To his left, Tomlin&#x2019;s detachment will have made it through by now and spread out so that the platoon is all together. They will be awaiting his order, as if there is any other possible choice but forward&#x2013;down into the trench and up the other side. <br><br>Baltimore raises his hand to signal the advance.<br><br>In quick succession, three soft pops puncture the night, followed by a strange whistling that ends when a trio of flares explode into brightness above the battlefield, casting the entirety of the scene in a garish white light, such that every corpse and trench and divot in the earth stands out in perfect detail. <br><br>The platoon is strung along the line of earth between barbed wire and trench, completely exposed. <br><br>Dread and fear turn to rigid ice in his veins and Baltimore freezes, legs locked in place like one of his cherished tin soldiers, feet welded to its base. He has failed his country, and the men who follow him. His gaze follows the flares as they rise to the peak of their arcs and seem to hang for a moment like angels on high. <br><br>Ten or twenty feet to the right, one of his men curses. The voice sounds as though it comes from a thousand miles away. They might as well have been separated by such distances&#x2013;all of them&#x2013;for in the moment when death comes, each man is alone.<br><br>Awash in white light, Baltimore looks down even as the trench comes alive with movement. The Hessians who have lain in wait rise, rifle and machine gun barrels swinging up to take aim.<br><i>A tin soldier cannot move. </i><br><br><i>He stands at the ready, rifle in hand, but it will take the hand of the child to move him into action against his enemy. The battlefield is a heavy blanket striped two shades of blue, wrinkled and ridged with hills up which the platoon of tin soldiers must be made to charge.</i><br><br><i>The war hesitates. It breathes with a light spring breeze flitting through the room.<br><br>The boy has gone for now. Allies and enemies are frozen on the brink. The great force that moves them all has abandoned them in the midst of this scene and terror grips the tin soldier. Paralyzed, he can only wait for the battle to start again. Once the boy returns, his fate will be decided. Perhaps he will survive, perhaps not, but it is the unknown that gnaws at him.<br><br>The bedroom window is open a crack, letting that spring air swirl and eddy into the room. Sunlight marks out an elongated rectangle upon the floor, cut through with a quartet of windowpane crosses. The laughter of children carries in on the breeze. The boy is outside, playing with others, when on that blue-striped blanket, the fate of two tin armies hangs frozen in the balance. <br><br>If the boy would only come in, if Henry would play with them and bring his laughter into the room, the tin soldier knows that all would be well. With the boy in the room there is warmth and happiness. There is safety. But in this petrified moment, anything can happen. <br><br>Anything at all.<br><br>The tin soldier cannot move.</i><br><i><br>A new sound enters the room. Harsh, chuffing laughter. This is no childhood merriment. It comes not from the green spring day outside the window, but from a shelf high on the wall. From within a wooden box, whose sides are painted and etched with grinning jester faces. A crank handle juts from one side of the box, unmoving. <br><br>But inside the box, something stirs.<br><br>The goblin Jack shifts inside his wooden box and there comes a thump thump thump of its wooden head striking the walls. A tinkle of jangling, happy music blats three notes, but the crank does not move. The laughter comes again&#x2013;a harsh, barking staccato, and the soldier knows there is something to fear more than losing his life, more than losing the war... </i><br>The gunfire punctures the air&#x2013;a harsh, barking staccato. The platoon are black silhouettes cut out of a brilliant white background. The angel flares float languidly downward, drifting on the autumn breeze. They begin to flicker almost in rhythm with the machine gun fire, turning the slaughter of Baltimore&#x2019;s men into a gruesome zoetrope&#x2013;a Grand Guignol of shadows and light. <br><br>Cries of pain and death rise all around him. Baltimore turns to the left and sees Sergeant Tomlin and another man stagger backward in a marionette dance of bullets and flesh. They are driven into the barbed wire and thrash there, tearing their flesh with each new motion. Bleeding. Dying. <br><br>To the right, the skinny private stands straight as though at attention, the top of his skull missing and a hole where his nose should be. An entry wound. Already dead, he still clutches his rifle and marches three steps forwardbefore tumbling down into the trench with the Hessians who have murdered him.<br><br><i>The tin soldier cannot move.</i> <br><br>Baltimore does not realize he has been shot until he feels hot blood sliding down his thigh and his left leg gives out. He does not even raise his rifle as he stumbles, attempting to hold himself up. The gun remains clutched in his hands, a useless bit of metal. <br><br>A fresh barrage of gunfire comes from the trench. And as he spins, falling, he sees the faces of the Hessian soldiers, dark with dirt for camouflage, loading their rifles and feeding ammunition into their heavy machine guns. As the flares begin to die, he sees the men of his platoon moving toward him, Stockton and the giant Macintosh forming around their captain. They return fire, but the ten rounds in the magazines of their rifles will not be enough.<br><br>Baltimore falls.<br><i>The tin soldier cannot see, but he can still hear the rasping, insinuating laughter of the thing in the carved box, the hideous Jack. The sound is like some terrible machine, a devil&#x2019;s factory. He knows that up on its shelf, in the box, the Jack stirs still, amused and waiting for its chance to emerge. <br><br>What it will do then, the tin soldier does not know. But he dreads the moment he will hear the bright, jarring calliope of its handle being cranked, for then he will know the Jack is about to be freed.</i> <br><i><br>For now, the laughter is horrid enough.<br><br>And then it ceases.<br><br>Time passes, though the soldier knows not how long. He feels the cold, unyielding press of his comrades all around him, tin arms and legs beneath him and pressing down from above. <br><br>They are back in their box, of course. The boy has gathered them up and packed them away until the mood strikes him for another war. To the boy, it is so simple, so innocent. <br><br>It is a comfort, being back in the box. Stifling, yes, for he is contorted in there, on his back with his legs jutting upward and all of those other tin me...</i></p><h2>Single Handed: The Inspiring True Story of Tibor &#34;Teddy&#34; Rubin--Holocaust Survivor, Korean War Hero, and Medal of Honor Recipient</h2><p><b>From a World War II concentration camp to the Korean War to the White House, this is the incredible story of Tibor &#x201c;Teddy&#x201d; Rubin, the only Holocaust survivor ever to receive a Medal of Honor...</b><br><br>In 1944, a thirteen-year-old Hungarian boy named Tibor Rubin was captured by the Nazis and sent to the notorious Mauthausen concentration camp. The teenager endured its horrors for more than a year. After surviving the Holocaust, he arrived penniless in America, barely speaking English.<br><br>In 1950, Tibor volunteered for service in the Korean War. After acts of heroism that included single-handedly defending a hill against an onslaught of enemy soldiers, braving sniper fire to rescue a wounded comrade, and commandeering a machine gun after its crew was killed, he was captured. As a POW, Tibor called on his experience in Mauthausen to help fellow GIs survive two and half years of captivity.<br><br>Tibor returned from Korea in 1953, but it wasn&#x2019;t until 2005&#x2014;at age 76&#x2014;that he was invited to the White House, where he received the Medal of Honor from President George W. Bush. It had taken over half a century for Tibor&#x2019;s adopted homeland to recognize this Jewish immigrant for acts of valor that went &#x201c;beyond the call of duty.&#x201d; But when it did, the former Hungarian refugee became the only survivor of the Holocaust to have earned America&#x2019;s highest military distinction.<br><br>Drawing on eyewitness accounts and extensive interviews, author Daniel M. Cohen presents the inspiring story of Tibor &#x201c;Teddy&#x201d; Rubin for the first time in its entirety and gives us a stirring portrait of a true hero.<br><br>INCLUDES PHOTOS</p><p><b>DANIEL M. COHEN</b> has worked as a filmmaker, journalist, and film critic for over thirty years. He has written and directed award-winning independent features and continues to work as a film critic. He lives in Santa Monica, California.<p></p><p>WASHINGTON, 2005</p><p>When the old veteran stepped out of the limousine, he hurt all over. His bad knee was the size of a softball. Both hips ached. His hands burned with arthritis, especially the right one, which was still riddled with shrapnel. Arterial sclerosis shortened his breath and jet lag made him weary and light-headed. With every step, his feet throbbed from neuropathy.</p><p>The former corporal had been hospitalized five times the previous year. His prognosis, on a slew of ills from heart disease to diabetes, was not good. But he had advised the doctors not to worry; he had taken matters into his own hands and had decided to live. He soon proved that he was stronger than his ailments, and now, as he entered an elegant drawing room, each new sensation, from the hum of excited conversation, to the clouds of sweet perfume, to the rustle of expensive suits, erased a little more of his chronic pain.</p><p>The old soldier would have preferred a seat, but his instructions were to stand. Remaining on his feet was a challenge, but it offered him a good view of the crowd. The people who meant the most to him were right up front; his wife, Yvonne, and their two kids; Dick and Leo, his only buddies still alive from Korea; Bud, the vet whom he had dubbed his &#x201c;chief of staff&#x201d;; and Michelle, the activist who had guided him through twenty years of soul-numbing setbacks. Finally there was his sister-in-law, Gloria&#x2014;the last survivor of his immediate family, a woman who had never liked him and probably still considered him a womanizing bum. The other hundred and fifty&#x2014;high-ranking bureaucrats, rows of men and women in dress uniforms that looked freshly delivered from the dry cleaners, a smattering of bearded rabbis&#x2014;were strangers. He nodded at one and all just the same.</p><p>A flurry of flashbulbs lit the room. Guests rose in a wave. The veteran squared his stance and put on a smile for President George Bush&#x2014;the younger Bush&#x2014;who entered briskly and took a place near the podium. Then a chaplain opened the ceremony. &#x201c;Almighty God, we are never beyond the touch of Your hand&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>God, again. Over the past seven decades the old man had prayed to, argued with, and on occasion angrily cursed Him. In his lowest moments he&#x2019;d sworn that if they ever met, he&#x2019;d sue Him. Recently, he&#x2019;d pretended that He didn&#x2019;t exist. But now He was back. For better or worse, God had followed him to the White House.</p><p>The chaplain continued. &#x201c;We have joined here to honor a great soldier and American hero, Corporal Tibor Rubin&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>After the benediction President Bush spoke affectionately about a Hungarian teenager who had survived a year in a German concentration camp, emigrated to America, joined the U.S. Army, and volunteered for service in the Korean War. Then came a remarkable service record.</p><p>Tibor Rubin defended a hill single-handedly against a massive onslaught of North Koreans. Later, he manned a machine gun and held off waves of attackers on his own. Then, after his capture by the Chinese, he helped fellow GIs to survive two and a half years of captivity. He used knowledge gained in the concentration camp to nurse sick buddies back to health and risked his life to steal food for them. And when the Chinese command offered to send him back to Communist Hungary, he declared that he preferred to remain with his American brothers, even though he was not a U.S. citizen.</p><p>The president got the high points right, but there were gaping holes in his narrative. He failed to mention the anti-Semitic sergeant who had repeatedly &#x201c;volunteered&#x201d; Rubin for dangerous missions, who had ordered the private to remain with an ammunition dump while the rest of the company retreated. The president did not reveal that this same sergeant had ditched the paperwork from at least two company commanders that recommended Rubin for a Medal of Honor. Nor did the president explain that for twenty-five years the Army&#x2019;s awards division had ignored the eyewitness accounts, notarized statements, petitions, and pleas of veterans&#x2019; organizations and legislators to recognize Rubin for his selfless courage. Was the president aware that, ultimately, it had taken an <i>act of Congress</i> for Tibor Rubin even to be <i>considered</i> for the medal?</p><p>When President Bush finished, an army spokesman read the official citation that honored Tibor &#x201c;Ted&#x201d; Rubin for &#x201c;conspicuous gallantry and extraordinary heroism&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. above and beyond the call of duty.&#x201d; Then, as he had been instructed, the seventy-six-year-old turned to one side, enabling the president to drape the Medal of Honor around his neck. A brief prayer followed, and the ceremony concluded.</p><p>It had been more than fifty years since the kid they were honoring had come home from Korea. For most of that time he&#x2019;d been all but anonymous. But now, according to tradition, whenever Tibor Rubin wore his medal, every soldier from privates to five-star generals was to acknowledge him with a salute, and to address him as &#x201c;sir&#x201d; or &#x201c;mister.&#x201d;</p><p>As he was escorted to the Pentagon, where he was to be inducted into the Hall of Heroes, Tibor Rubin reflected on the events of recent years. All but two of the handful of veterans who had struggled for so long on his behalf were gone. Did the powers that be, some sitting before him in the best seats, really understand what these men had endured&#x2014;first during the war; then, over the past twenty-five years&#x2014;in order to make this twenty-minute ceremony happen? And would it have made any difference had they understood? Maybe. Or maybe not.</p><p>A few years ago, when all of this pomp and ceremony was still a dream, Tibor had told a reporter that what he wanted most of all was for everyone to know that there was &#x201c;a little greenhorn, a little schmuck from Hungary, who had fought for his beloved country.&#x201d; Today, he had cracked to another reporter that he was now &#x201c;<i>Mister Schmuck</i>, the hero.&#x201d;</p><p>With the Medal of Honor finally resting on his chest, Tibor Rubin limped on to the Hall of Heroes, where he smiled for photographers, shook hands with guests, and kept his true history to himself.</p><p></p><p></p><p><i>P�szt�, 1938</i></p><p>1</p><p>Tibor Rubin&#x2019;s first encounter with death came when he was nine years old. It was on a warm September morning in 1938, in the small Hungarian town of P�szt�, about a hundred kilometers from Budapest. Shortly after breakfast Tibor&#x2019;s father took the slight, close-cropped boy to the house of an elderly neighbor and ushered him into a darkened bedroom. The neighbor, a respected member of the Jewish community, lay on a bed, covered by a black blanket.</p><p>It was the first time that the boy had ever been so close to a dead body. His mischievous smile turned to a frown. Frightened, he tugged his father&#x2019;s arm. He wanted to run, but Ferenc Rubin held him fast and, in a stern voice, explained that according to Jewish law, the dead could not be left alone, and that since the others in the community were busy, Tibor would have to keep the body company until the burial service, late that afternoon. His father made it clear that the boy was not to leave the house for any reason. A moment later Ferenc was gone.</p><p>Ever since Tibor had cowered in his seat watching <i>Frankenstein</i> in P�szt�&#x2019;s only movie theater, he had been fearful of the dead, particularly of their coming back to life. But it was unthinkable to disobey his father. He perched as far away from the dead man as he could and kept a close watch on the black blanket in case the body beneath it showed any signs of life. He resolved that if it moved, even an inch, he would crawl under the bed and cry for help. But he would not leave.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Rubin Family, circa 1939. Left to right (front): Ilonka, Rosa, Ferenc, Tibor (back ): Irene, Edith, Emery</p><p>Family of Irene Rubin</p><p></p><p></p><p>Tibor&#x2019;s worst fears about the dead neighbor never came to pass. The body remained still until the burial party arrived and relieved him. Then he sprinted home and bragged to his brother and sisters that he had survived an entire day within spitting distance of a dead man. Even his four-year-old sister was amazed.</p><p>Tibor thought his duty was done, but Ferenc was so proud of his performance that he volunteered him to act as the guardian of the dead, the &#x201c;shomer,&#x201d; whenever the need arose.</p><p>The thought of it paralyzed Tibor, but he couldn&#x2019;t argue with his father. That was unheard of in the Rubin house.</p><p>From the time the Rubin children were toddlers, Ferenc Rubin had maintained a powerful grip over them. He demanded that their rooms be immaculate and conducted daily inspections. He made sure that after school they went straight to Hebrew classes. And the night of the Sabbath, he ordered them to take whatever small change was in their pockets and deposit it in the synagogue poor box.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Emery and Tibor, circa early 1940s.</p><p>Family of Irene Rubin</p><p></p><p></p><p>But there was another side to his father that confused Tibor. While Ferenc was strict about their Jewish identity, he insisted that the children mix with both Jews and non-Jews, and that they regard everyone in town with the same respect. This frustrated Tibor because on Saturday, when his gentile friends were out having fun, his father made him stay home to study the Torah. What made it even worse was that on some Saturdays, his handsome brother, Emery, who was seven years older, managed to slip away to play soccer. None of it made sense.</p><p>Tibor complied with Ferenc&#x2019;s rules, but he never got over his fear of the dead. If he heard a rumor that an older member of the community was sick, he tried to keep his distance from Ferenc. If their condition worsened, he hid in the woods.</p><p>Then a lawyer passed away, a widower whose wife had been deceased for several years. Since he had no relatives in P�szt�, Tibor was once again recruited to keep the dead man company. Midway through the afternoon, after his nerves settled, Tibor stretched out on a chaise longue and fell asleep. When he awoke, the body was uncovered. Suddenly the boy was staring at a dead man.</p><p>Had the corpse miraculously come back to life? Had evil spirits somehow reanimated him, like in <i>Frankenstein</i>? If not, then what was the black blanket doing on the floor?</p><p>Tibor&#x2019;s first impulse was to run out and slam the door behind him, but that would certainly result in punishment. He thought to cover his head with a pillow or crawl under the chaise, but how would that protect him? Then, after a nerve-jangling minute of uncertainty during which the corpse remained perfectly still, Tibor developed a competing impulse, almost as strong as his near panic: to see what a dead man looked like close up. So he took a deep breath and faced him straight on. No movement. He took a step nearer. The body remained stone still on the bed. Creeping closer, Tibor observed its limply cupped hands, its eyes focused dimly at the ceiling, its mouth slightly open, as though the man had passed in the act of prayer. Despite the first bolts of fear, no vengeful spirits descended to scold Tibor for allowing the blanket to drop and expose the man&#x2019;s corpse. As he examined it at arm&#x2019;s length, he realized that there was nothing to fear from a body once its soul had departed. In fact, it was actually quite peaceful.</p><p>At that moment young Tibor Rubin came to an accommodation with death. While the process of dying was still a dark mystery, the dead no longer controlled the same terror-filled space in his mind. On a level that he was barely aware of, Tibor became a different person.</p><p>2</p><p>Because he had so faithfully fulfilled his obligations, Tibor hoped that his father might allow him to slack off on Hebrew school. He felt that the tongue-twisting Hebrew and endless Jewish laws were just too much to bear. Beyond that, he thought he got enough religion at home. But Ferenc wouldn&#x2019;t hear of it. He forbade the boy from missing a single class.</p><p>Tibor didn&#x2019;t understand his father. While he dressed like a modern man, with his suits, bowler hats, and stylish mustache, he didn&#x2019;t act like one. And though the older kids said that he&#x2019;d become kinder since the birth of Ilonka&#x2014;his youngest daughter&#x2014;he remained inflexible about their religious training.</p><p>Tibor was dutiful, but he couldn&#x2019;t tolerate Jewish school day after day, no matter how hard his father pressed him. When he was caught skipping class, the rabbi sent angry notes home to his parents. After several such notes, Ferenc concluded that his dim-witted youngest son lacked character and that he would never be of any use to himself or the community.</p><p>But Tibor&#x2019;s mother, Rosa, who was far more forgiving, disagreed, and together she and Tibor conspired to prove his father wrong. Since there was only one car in their town of six thousand&#x2014;a taxi&#x2014;and since postage was expensive, Rosa encouraged Tibor to start a delivery service. The work would keep him busy at the same time that it served the community. Soon Tibor was trotting from one neighborhood to another, delivering everything from wedding invitations to shoes from Ferenc&#x2019;s store. As he made the rounds from house to house, grateful customers handed him small tips for his efforts. Gradually his pockets filled with coins.</p><p>He liked the feeling of having a little money. For the first time he could buy sweets for himself and his friends and tickets for the movies, despite his father&#x2019;s disapproval. Ferenc considered the comedies, adventures, and thrillers that Tibor craved a bad influence, a distraction from the real responsibilities of life. But once Tibor had money of his own, he stole away to P�szt�&#x2019;s little theater whenever he wanted. Tibor adored Laurel and Hardy, Tarzan, and <i>Frankenstein</i>, which he saw four times. But more than anything else, he loved movies about America.</p><p>The United States of America struck Tibor as the biggest and best country in the world. Its cowboys and gangsters and detectives and daredevils thrilled him. He was awed by its wide-open spaces and towering cities. America was a magical land where people talked to each other on telephones, dressed in top hats and tails, and drove gleaming automobiles.</p><p>Tibor promised himself that one day he would leave P�szt� and its oppressive Jewish school behind. He would dump all of it and travel to America, where he could live free of the arcane laws his father and the rabbis had forced down his throat. But the boy didn&#x2019;t realize that it was already too late for that, too late to wipe his brain clean of history and the complicated regimen of Jewish life. At the age of nine, Tibor didn&#x2019;t appreciate the impact that the rabbi, his father, his community, and the Torah had already made, and how the rigorous traditions that seemed like such a burden would later inspire his countless acts of selfless bravery.</p><p>3</p><p>Tibor was ten years old when a bearded young man wearing an oil-stained coat and muddy shoes appeared at the Rubins&#x2019; door. After welcoming the stranger into their house, Tibor&#x2019;s mother took him aside. &#x201c;Your cousin from America has come to visit,&#x201d; she whispered. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s been so long since he&#x2019;s been here that your father and I need to spend time with him alone.&#x201d;</p><p>Tibor was eager to talk to the cousin about his fascinating life in America, but most of the conversation at the dinner ...</p></p><h2>Kitty Rocks the House (Kitty Norville, 11)</h2><p><p><b>The latest novel in the Carrie Vaughn's <i>New York Times </i>best selling urban fantasy series featuring werewolf Kitty Vaughn</b></p><p>On the heels of Kitty's return from London, a new werewolf shows up in Denver, one who threatens to split the pack by challenging Kitty's authority at every turn.

She lives in Boulder, Colorado.</p>Chapter 1 <br>&nbsp; <br> <br>FOR ALL the death I&#x2019;d seen, I&#x2019;d been to very few funerals. <br>This one was fraught, and I couldn&#x2019;t sort out my feelings, or what I was supposed to be feeling. Grandma Norville had fallen and broken her hip three months ago, but the pneumonia she caught after had been the final culprit. I kept thinking I should have been there. I could have come to visit one more time if I hadn&#x2019;t been so busy, if I&#x2019;d just made the effort. But I thought she&#x2019;d hang on longer. I thought she&#x2019;d always be here. How selfish was it, to feel guilty at someone&#x2019;s funeral, as if her passing were somehow my fault, or a personal inconvenience? I was sad, nostalgic, tired, shell-shocked. <br>Mostly, I was worried about my father. He seemed tall and stoic enough, his chin up, eyes dry. Mom held her arm wrapped around his and kept a tissue close to her eyes. He didn&#x2019;t seem to be looking at anything, though. Not the flower-drenched casket, not the dark-suited minister, not the sky or grassy lawn with its rows of modern, polished headstones. I couldn&#x2019;t tell what he was thinking. I couldn&#x2019;t ask. <br>The service was graveside, the springtime Arizona weather was reasonable&#x2014;sunny, but windy. I kept squinting against dust in the air. The crowd gathered was small, incongruously young. All of Grandma&#x2019;s friends, siblings, and her husband had gone before her. All that was left were her three kids, their families, and a couple of staff from her retirement home. It had been a quiet ceremony. <br>My husband Ben and I had driven all night to get here. We stood a little apart from the others. Not so much as to be noticeable, but enough to be comfortable for us. Werewolves didn&#x2019;t do so well in groups, even ones as small as this. Especially when we were off balance. We stood side by side, our hands entwined. Ben had never even met Grandma. He was here to look out for me. A rock to stand next to. He&#x2019;d pulled out polish, combing the scruff out of his light brown hair and wearing his best courtroom lawyer suit with a muted navy tie. I&#x2019;d had a terrible time packing, convinced that all my clothes were inappropriate for the situation. I&#x2019;d settled on a black skirt and tailored cream blouse for the service, and pinned my blond hair up in a twist. I looked like a waitress. <br>The rest of the family had flown ahead of us. My sister Cheryl&#x2019;s husband, Mark, had stayed home with their two kids. Standing next to Mom, hugging herself, Cheryl seemed small in her dress suit, which she probably hadn&#x2019;t worn since before she was pregnant with Nicky, eight years ago now. She was staring at the flowers with a wrinkled, worried frown. <br>The minister, a nondenominational chaplain from the retirement home, spoke in a calm, inoffensive voice. He&#x2019;d started with a Bible verse, the one about walking in the valley of shadows and not fearing evil, and dispensed comforting words of wisdom that might have come from the lyrics of a sixties folk song. <br>What would the guy say if I told him that I&#x2019;d had proof that people existed in some form after death? He&#x2019;d probably say, of course. He was a minister, after all. I had proof of life after death. But I couldn&#x2019;t say I believed in heaven or hell. I still didn&#x2019;t know what exactly happened to us after we died. What had happened to my grandmother. <br>When people at the funeral told me that my grandmother had gone to a better place, did I believe them? I believed that part of her lived on. But I couldn&#x2019;t say where she was. Was she here, watching us mourn for her? I resisted an urge to call out loud to her, just in case. Was the cemetery filled with the shadows of the dead, all of them watching? <br>I&#x2019;d met beings who claimed to be gods. Were they, or were they just powerful people who had existed for thousands of years and so built up a tangle of stories around them, and in those stories they became gods? <br>When the minister called on his own God, did he really know who he was praying to? <br>In matters of faith, I couldn&#x2019;t believe in much of anything anymore. I had my family who loved me, my friends I could count on, and that was about it. Everything else&#x2014;I saw the signs, but I didn&#x2019;t know what they meant. All I could do was focus on the road in front of me. <br>The chaplain said his amens, the rest of us echoed him, he closed his book, and that was that. I decided Grandma would have been disappointed with the whole thing. She&#x2019;d have wanted something big and grand in a cathedral, with organ music. But this wasn&#x2019;t for her, it was for the rest of us. Funny how we all seemed so anxious. I wasn&#x2019;t sure having a chance to say good-bye at a funeral was any better than not having a chance to say good-bye, when the people you loved were snatched away in front of you without ceremony. <br>We filed back to the cars parked along the curb, leaving the flowers and casket behind. The earth that would fill in the grave had been discreetly hidden away during the ceremony, and would be brought back after we&#x2019;d all left. I spotted the cemetery employees who would do the deed lurking behind a well-groomed hedge, waiting. <br>I squeezed Ben&#x2019;s hand before letting go and trotted forward to catch up to my dad. <br>&#x201c;Dad? You okay?&#x201d; <br>He smiled a sad smile, putting his arm around my shoulders and pulling me close to give me a kiss on the top of my head. Without a word, he let me go and kept walking on with my mother. <br>So what did that mean? <br>My aunt, Dad&#x2019;s younger sister, was hosting a lunch&#x2014;catered, I found out after discretely poking among my cousins, which was a relief. Friends had been bringing over mountains of food as well. I didn&#x2019;t want to find out anyone had been cooking for everybody, but no one had. A little less guilt there. I slipped my cousins some money to help with the cost. Wasn&#x2019;t much else I could do. Ben got directions to their house; I&#x2019;d never been there. I was close to my immediate family, but I didn&#x2019;t see the extended family that often. Weddings and funerals, and that was it. Another clich� in a day filled with them. <br>Before we reached the car, I took a last look over the cemetery&#x2019;s green slope, toward the row of folding chairs and the mountain of flowers that marked Grandma&#x2019;s grave. Said a farewell, just in case she was hanging around, and just in case she could hear. <br>Ben had stopped a few yards away from me and gazed off to a stand of bordering trees. Two figures, a man and a woman, were standing there. <br>&#x201c;You see that?&#x201d; he said, nodding toward them. <br>&#x201c;Yeah. They just keeping an eye on us or do they want to make trouble?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You want to find out?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I kind of do,&#x201d; I said, and we started toward them. <br>They&#x2019;d put themselves upwind so we&#x2019;d be sure to catch their scents: musky, odd. Werewolves and foreign&#x2014;not part of our pack. He was a big, burly Latino; she was young and motherly, her dark hair in a ponytail, a gray cardigan over her jeans and blouse. When we approached within speaking distance, they lowered their gazes. She started fidgeting, shuffling her feet&#x2014;pacing, almost. <br>&#x201c;You must be Andy and Michelle,&#x201d; I said. <br>She blushed and smiled; he nodded, only raising his gaze to us for brief moments. The werewolf pair had gone submissive, which was a little unnerving&#x2014;they were the alphas of the Phoenix pack, strong and dominant. I&#x2019;d been able to send a message ahead to warn them we were coming, that we had no intentions of invading, and could we please have permission to stay in their territory for as long as we needed for the funeral? They&#x2019;d sent a welcoming message back. I wasn&#x2019;t sure we&#x2019;d even meet them while we were here, or if they&#x2019;d keep their distance. <br>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; Ben said. &#x201c;For letting us pass through. I hope it hasn&#x2019;t caused any trouble.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh, no,&#x201d; Andy said. &#x201c;I hope <i>you</i> haven&#x2019;t had any trouble. You haven&#x2019;t, have you? You have everything you need? Is there anything else we can do for you? A place to run, maybe?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Ben said. &#x201c;Full moon&#x2019;s not for another week, fortunately.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Ah, good,&#x201d; Michelle said. &#x201c;I mean, not good&#x2014;I&#x2019;m really sorry about your grandmother.&#x201d; <br>My polite smile was feeling awfully stiff. &#x201c;Thanks. We&#x2019;d probably better get back to it. We&#x2019;ll let you know if we need anything. Really.&#x201d; I started backing away slowly. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s nice meeting you,&#x201d; Michelle said. She was so earnest I could almost see her tail wagging. &#x201c;I mean&#x2014;you&#x2019;re not really what we expected.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What did you expect?&#x201d; I said. <br>She ducked her gaze. &#x201c;Well, you both look so friendly. I guess we expected you to be&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Tougher. Tougher <i>looking,</i>&#x201d; Andy finished. His smile appeared as strained as my own felt. &#x201c;Given some of the stories we&#x2019;ve heard.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I think some of those stories exaggerate.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Even so. It&#x2019;s still pretty impressive.&#x201d; <br>I shuddered to think. Exactly what did I look like from the outside, anyway? I was just a talk radio host. A werewolf talk radio host who&#x2019;d publically declared war on a shadowy vampire conspiracy. Alrighty, then. <br>&#x201c;Thanks again,&#x201d; Ben said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be out of your territory in a couple of days.&#x201d; <br>Their smiles suddenly seemed relieved. Ben and I waved good-bye and walked back to the cars. <br>I frowned. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ve been keeping an eye on us the whole time we&#x2019;ve been here, haven&#x2019;t they? Just to make sure we wouldn&#x2019;t start a fight.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Seems likely.&#x201d; His smile was amused, his hands shoved in the pockets of his suit jacket. I was a little offended that he wasn&#x2019;t more worried, or at least insulted. <br>&#x201c;They acted like I might try to eat them. When did I become such a badass?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Your reputation precedes you,&#x201d; Ben said. <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t even know what reputation that is anymore. I don&#x2019;t even recognize myself, the way they were looking at me.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let it go to your head.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;On the contrary, I think I&#x2019;d rather ignore it completely.&#x201d; I wouldn&#x2019;t know how to act like the badass tough they&#x2019;d expected. <br>Cheryl was watching our approach from the edge of the groups of relatives still lingering and talking. There was one person who&#x2019;d never see her little sister as a badass. <br>&#x201c;Do you know them?&#x201d; she asked. Andy and Michelle were walking away, into a different section of the cemetery. <br>&#x201c;Not really,&#x201d; I said, and left it at that. <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re kinda weird, you know that?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a <i>werewolf,</i>&#x201d; I said, glaring. &#x201c;Trust me, Cheryl, you don&#x2019;t want to know.&#x201d; <br>She rolled her eyes at me. <br>It wasn&#x2019;t until the reception was almost over, after Mom, Dad, and Cheryl had already left for their hotel room, after I&#x2019;d said good-bye to all the relatives without knowing when I was going to see any of them again&#x2014;we made noises about a family reunion, or maybe a big wedding anniversary celebration, or something&#x2014;and Ben and I were walking out to our car, parked at the curb a block down the street, that I started crying. The tears burst, all at once, without warning, soaking my cheeks. I choked on a blubbering breath I couldn&#x2019;t quite seem to catch. <br>Stopping, I squeezed my eyes shut and held my nose in an effort to stop the stinging. <br>&#x201c;Kitty?&#x201d; Ben had gone on a few more steps before looking back. <br>I took a deep, stuttering breath that staved off the waterworks. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine. It just got me for a second.&#x201d; <br>He took my hand and leaned close, not to kiss me, but to let his breath play over my neck. His touch, the scent of him, calmed me. I was safe, I was protected. We stood like that for a moment, taking comfort in each other&#x2019;s presence. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll drive, okay?&#x201d; he said finally. <br>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; <br>I slouched in the passenger seat, watching the suburban tract housing pass by as we drove away. I turned over the thought that had pushed me over the edge, had triggered the grief I&#x2019;d kept at bay for the last few days. Grandma had always called me Katherine, refusing any less dignified nickname. Never mind that I hadn&#x2019;t displayed a lot of dignity as a kid. To her, I was Katherine. <br>Then it hit me: now, the only people in the world who&#x2019;d call me Katherine were vampires with an overdeveloped sense of decorum. It was enough to make anyone cry. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2013 by Carrie Vaughn, LLC <br></p><h2>The Washing of the Spears: A History of the Rise of the Zulu Nation under Shaka, and Its Fall in the Zulu War of 1879</h2><p>The title says it all.

Phoebe's quest to see as many birds as possible only began at the age of 34, when she first laid eyes on a resplendent Blackburnian Warbler. Both a lively chronicle of birding adventures and a profoundly moving human document, <i>Birding on Borrowed Time</i> is the memoir of a truly extraordinary woman.

After her belated awakening to the avian marvels around her, Phoebe began traveling across the globe, to all seven continents, observing and learning as much as she could about the world&#39;s thousands of bird species. The intensity and urgency of her quest were quickened when a cancer diagnosis led doctors to give her one year to live. Instead of succumbing to despair, Phoebe pursued her passion and strove to live what remained of her life to its fullest. Miraculously, she defied her death sentence, living on to see more of the world and more new birds for 17 additional years. Along the way, she faced other hazards: a brutal assault and rape in New Guinea, a shipwreck, earthquakes, and political upheaval, along with recurrences of malignant melanoma. But in the end she triumphed over adversity and fulfilled her lifelong dream by becoming the first person to see more than 8,000 of the world&#39;s birds - a remarkable achievement that required passion, knowledge, skill, dedication, and persistence.</p><h2>The Secret Doctrine: Vol. 1: Cosmogenesis, Vol. 2: Anthropogenesis</h2><p>Facsimile of 1888 edition. These two volumes now issued do not complete the scheme, and these do not treat exhaustively of the subjects dealt with in them. A large quantity of material has already been prepared, dealing with the history of occultism as contained in the lives of the great Adepts of the Aryan Race, and showing the bearing of occult philosophy upon the conduct of life, as it is and as it ought to be.These truths are in no sense put forward as a revelation; nor does the author claim the position of a revealer of mystic lore, now made public for the first time in the world&#x2019;s history. For what is contained in this work is to be found scattered throughout thousands of volumes embodying the scriptures of the great Asiatic and early European religions. What is now attempted is to gather the oldest tenets together and to make of them one harmonious and unbroken whole. The publication of many of the facts herein stated has been rendered necessary by the wild and fanciful speculations in which many Theosophists and students of mysticism have indulged in their endeavor to, as they imagined, work out a complete system of thought from the few facts previously communicated to them. It is needless to explain that this book is not the Secret Doctrine in its entirety, but a select number of fragments of its fundamental tenets, special attention being paid to some facts which have been seized upon by various writers, and distorted out of all resemblance to the truth. But it is perhaps desirable to state unequivocally that the teachings, however fragmentary and incomplete, contained in these volumes, belong neither to the Hindu, the Zoroastrian, the Chaldean, nor the Egyptian religion, neither to Buddhism, Islam, Judaism nor Christianity exclusively. The Secret Doctrine is the essence of all these. Sprung from it in their origins, the various religious schemes are now made to merge back into their original element, out of which every mystery and dogma has grown.</p><p><b>Helena Petrovna Blavatsky</b> (1831-1891) was the cofounder of the Theosophical Society.

If you've ever wondered what to do with all those products, then this book is for you.</p><p>If you've been using acrylic in traditional painting forms, in this book you'll find grand, wild and inventive manipulations of acrylic that will get your creative juices flowing.</p><p>Compared to more traditional art mediums such as oil and watercolor, acrylic is still in its infancy. But what it lacks in years, it makes up for in its range of use. Acrylics appeared on the market for artists in the late 1940s as a quick-drying alternative to oil paint. In its early manifestations, it dried so quickly that more than a few brushes stuck immediately to the canvas!</p><p>Although acrylic has been around for more than fifty years, incredible advances continue to be made in the research and development of acrylic polymers and pigments. These advancements are attributable not only to the efforts of a few dedicated chemists, but also to the work of an entire community devoted to acrylic. There are a lot of brilliant minds taking these minute molecules very seriously.</p></p><p>Patti Brady's paintings, prints and hand-painted books have been exhibited nationally and reviewed by the <i>New York Times</i>.

He has authored numerous works of fiction, including Grass Dancer, a Nebula Award Finalist. Goingback lives in Florida.A first novel about an ancient monster that emerges from beneath the earth to terrorize a Missouri small town. Some shift in a faultline has awakened the monster, which is huge and demonlike, with evil-seeming eyes. It looks something like a bear and has the skin and slithering capability of a reptile. And it's hungry. First, it kills a teenage boy on the way to pick up his date, then the man who discovers him. Then it devours a herd of cattle and the farmer who tries to defend them- -giving rise to cattle mutilation stories among the locals. Bullets won't stop the monster, because it's really a demon. Only magic will work: Goingback, who is Choctaw, pits Jay Little Hawk against the demon, but even he, with all of his hunting lore, must consult with an old shaman to divine just what the demon is and how it can be killed. Little Hawk joins with the local sheriff, Skip Harding, who did battle with the demon and lived to tell the tale, and together the two bring the thing down with a magic, stone-pointed arrow. All of which is extremely similar to--though far less imaginative than--last summer's Christian crossover, Frank Peretti's The Oath. Goingback is readable and his Choctaw lore appealing. But his story quickly drops into the banal suspense of a Dean Koontz or Clive Barker. He isn't, however, any worse. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Though he died at the young age of fifty-seven more than half a century ago, his influence among actors and filmmakers, and his enduring appeal for film lovers around the world, remains as strong as ever. What is it about Bogart, with his unconventional looks and noticeable speech impediment, that has captured our collective imagination for so long? In this definitive biography, Stefan Kanfer answers that question, along the way illuminating the private man Bogart was and shining the spotlight on some of the greatest performances ever captured on celluloid.<br><br>Bogart fell into show business almost by accident and worked for nearly twenty years before becoming the star we know today. Born into a life of wealth and privilege in turn-of-the-century New York, Bogart was a troublemaker throughout his youth, getting kicked out of prep school and running away to join the navy at the age of nineteen. After a short, undistinguished stint at sea, Bogart spent his early twenties drifting aimlessly from one ill-fitting career to another, until, through a childhood friend, he got his first theater job. Working first as a stagehand and then, reluctantly, as a bit-part player, Bogart cut his teeth in one forgettable role after another. But it was here he began to develop a work ethic; deciding that there were &#x201c;two kinds of men: professionals and bums,&#x201d; Bogart, for the first time in his life, wanted to be the former.<br><br>After the Crash of &#x2019;29, Bogart headed west to try his luck in Hollywood. That luck was scarce, and he slogged through more than thirty B-movie roles before his drinking buddy John Huston wrote him a part that would change everything; with <i>High Sierra</i>, Bogart finally broke through at the age of forty&#x2014;being a pro had paid off. <br><br>What followed was a string of movies we have come to know as the most beloved classics of American cinema: <i>The Maltese Falcon</i>, <i>Casablanca</i>, <i>The Big Sleep</i>, <i>The African Queen</i> . . . the list goes on and on. Kanfer appraises each of the films with an unfailing critical eye, weaving in lively accounts of behind-the-scenes fun and friendships, including, of course, the great love story of Bogart and Bacall. What emerges in these pages is the portrait of a great Hollywood life, and the final word on why there can only ever be one Bogie.</p><p>Stefan Kanfer&#x2019;s books include <i>Ball of Fire: The Tumultuous Life and Comic Art of Lucille Ball; Stardust Lost: The Triumph, Tragedy, and </i>Mishugas<i> of the Yiddish Theater in America; </i>and<i> Somebody: The Reckless Life and Remarkable Career of Marlon Brando</i>.

He lives in New York and on Cape Cod.chapter 1<br><br>The End Depends on the Beginning<br><br>i<br><br>In the 150-year history of cinema, few performers have arrived with a more impressive r�sum� of monetary privilege and social distinction. Humphrey Bogart's father, Belmont DeForest Bogart, was a high-toned graduate of Phillips Andover prep school and Columbia University; his medical degree came from Yale. Belmont rarely failed to inform classmates and colleagues that the Bogarts of Holland were among the earliest settlers in New York, and that one of their ancestors was the first "European" child to be born in that state.<br><br>Actually, the Bogarts had been a line of burghers and truck farmers until Belmont's father, Adam, came along. He married late, became an innkeeper to support his wife and child, and compulsively tinkered in his off-hours. Lithography-etching on large, unwieldy stones-had become popular in the later nineteenth century; Adam seized the day, creating a process for transfering lithographs to portable sheets of tin. Printers wanted in on this new invention, and the sales made him a rich man. It was a classic case of an old family with new money, very much in the spirit of the nineteenth century. Adam relocated to Manhattan, taking comfort in the knowledge that many a New York City plutocrat had humble beginnings: Jacob Astor started out as a fur trapper; Peter Schermerhorn as a ship chandler; Frederick and William Rhinelander as bakers; Peter Lorillard as a tobacco merchant.<br><br>Adam maneuvered the family name into the Blue Book of New York City society and, after his wife died, concentrated all his energy and ambition on his only son. There would be no hayseed in this boy's hair; no scent of the carbolic acid used to clean hotel rooms would cling to his clothes as it had to his father's. Adam was sharply aware of Power of Personality, a book by the business writer Orison Swett Marden. "In this fiercely competitive age," warned the author, "when the law of the survival of the fittest acts with seemingly merciless rigor, no one can afford to be indifferent to the smallest detail of dress, or manner, or appearance, that will add to his chance of success." Adam's son was caparisoned in the right wardrobe, sent to the best private schools, given a generous allowance. Pushed and prodded to get on in this ruthless new world, Belmont aimed high. Early on, he made up his mind to major in science and biology, get admitted to Yale Medical School, and then forge his own reputation as a physician. By his early thirties Dr. Bogart had realized his goals, serving on the staffs of three prominent Manhattan hospitals: Bellevue, St. Luke's, and Sloan.<br><br>During that time, however, an accident wholly altered his life. He was riding in a horse-drawn ambulance when the animal got spooked in traffic, reared, and overturned the vehicle. Belmont's leg was broken, badly set, and then reset to correct the original errors. Morphine and other drugs were prescribed to lessen the misery. He leaned on them to get through the nights.<br><br>Still, he was tall, slim, and attractive; sporting a cane, he continued to make his professional rounds and attend parties, customarily introduced as one of the city's most eligible bachelors. It was at one of those preaccident f�tes that the thirty-year-old medical man had met the twenty-nine-year-old daughter of a Rochester, New York, stove salesman. Maud Humphrey was almost Belmont's height, not quite beautiful, but striking, with russet hair, a determined jaw, and a slender, shapely figure. She was also famous. At the age of sixteen the art prodigy had sold drawings to magazines. After studying in Paris and New York she caught on as an illustrator of calendars, children's books, and advertisements for Ivory soap and Metropolitan Life Insurance. Everywhere Belmont looked, he saw her pictures.<br><br>In their intelligent study, Maud Humphrey: Her Permanent Imprint on American Illustration, Karen Choppa and Paul Humphrey suggest that, skilled as she was, Maud owed much of her early success to industrial timing. Just as Enrico Caruso came along when single-sided wax recordings were being mass-produced, so Maud's meticulous watercolor technique turned out to be ideal for the brand-new methods of lithographic reproduction. Her renderings of moppets and misses were sentimental without being cloying, and expertly done; they made her the best-known illustrator of her time. When she and Belmont Bogart first met, he was drawing a yearly salary of twenty thousand dollars, an excellent sum in those days. Maud Humphrey was already earning more than twice as much.<br><br>A liaison began, interrupted by Maud's militant feminism: Belmont's nineteenth-century, male-centered view made the suffragist uncomfortable. They broke off. Two years later she heard about his accident and dropped by to express her sympathy. She paid another call, and another, and another. During one rendezvous the pair abruptly decided that personal politics be damned, they could not live without each other. A week later an item appeared in the Ontario County Times of June 15, 1898. It explained that in view of Dr. Bogart's indisposition,<br><br>Miss Humphrey thought she would rather nurse her husband through his trial than visit him duly chaperoned at stated intervals, so about the middle of the week the young couple announced casually that they were going to be married Saturday, and they were, with only a handful of cousins to give away the orphaned artist. The honeymoon will be spent in a hospital. Mrs. Bogart, nee Humphrey, is a connection of Admiral Dewey, and is also related to the Churchills and the Van Rensselaers.<br><br>The newlyweds bought a four-story town house at 245 West 103rd Street, between Riverside Drive and West End Avenue, then a toney address. Down the hill was Riverside Park, leading to the mile-wide Hudson River and the picturesque craggy Palisades; across the street was the Hotel Marseille, city home of folks like Sara Roosevelt, mother of the future president Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The Bogarts had four live-in help (two maids, a cook, and a laundress); their combined salaries added up to less than twenty dollars a week. In 1899, Maud gave birth to the Bogarts' first child and only son. He had something of his father's dark coloring, modified by his mother's delicate bone structure. The boy was christened with her maiden name, and there was great rejoicing. Before Humphrey was out of swaddling clothes Belmont made plans to enter him at Phillips Andover, predicting that someday young Bogart would become a doctor, like his old man. Over the next five years two daughters were added to the family. In keeping with Maud's progressive outlook, all three children were instructed to address her by her first name. None of them ever called her "Mother." She was not a great believer in hugs, either. A pat on the back or a soft clip on the shoulder was her way of showing affection. Belmont was undemonstrative as well, but this was in keeping with a man of his class and period. Thus he had enormous expectations of his handsome son; thus he assumed that Frances and Catherine would simply marry well and raise their own families. Maud demurred. They could have lives and jobs of their own; a new day was dawning for women. It was the beginning of many arguments about the family, and about life itself.<br><br>For more than a decade the three little Bogarts enjoyed an atmosphere of ostentatious comfort, surrounded by reproductions of classical statues, heavy tapestries, and overstuffed horsehair couches and chairs. They played with the latest toys, were luxuriously togged, and ate the best food money could buy. When Maud and Belmont dined out, it was at stylish restaurants like Delmonico's and the Lafayette, but those occasions were rare; they were around the house much of the time. The doctor received patients in a mahogany-lined office on the first floor, and the artist did her work in a studio at the top of the house. On many occasions she sketched and painted until after midnight, when the only sound was the cooing of pigeons on the roof. Belmont raised them in his spare time; it was one of his many hobbies. His favorite avocation was sailing, something he had done as a youth. To that end, the Bogarts acquired an estate on the exclusive shore of Canandaigua Lake, one of the long, wide Finger Lakes in upstate New York. Willow Brook's fifty-five acres contained a working farm, an icehouse, and broad lawns leading down to the dock where Belmont kept a yacht he called the Comrade.<br><br>So far, so Edwardian. Yet there were cracks in this grand fa�ade, imperceptible to most outsiders but sadly apparent to Humphrey, Frances, and Catherine. For Maud and Belmont were running out of mutual affection. It was not a question of lovers or mistresses. They had gradually, and then not so gradually, grown apart, vanishing into their professional obligations and political beliefs, into alcohol, and, in Belmont's case, into morphine addiction. They fought much of the time, usually behind closed doors. But in hot weather secrets could not be kept so easily. Maud suffered from migraine headaches, and through the open windows her throaty voice could be overheard by neighbors, bawling out the children for some trivial misbehavior. Her outbursts were often followed by Belmont's own tantrums. Those could lead to harsh corporal punishment; like his father before him, Belmont was a believer in the razor strop as an instrument of moral instruction. At Willow Brook the children's lives veered between the terror of evening quarrels and the delights of lyrical summer afternoons.<br><br>For Humphrey, some of the pleasure came from his newfound role as leader of the Seneca Point Gang. This was a self-styled group of adolescent boys who addressed him as "Hump," a nickname he found congenial. They skinny-dipped in local streams, built their own clubhouse of spare planks, played war with lead soldiers, and put on amateurish stage plays at the lakefront beach. There was nothing remarkable about these productions except for the costumes. They were the real thing, Broadway discards donated by William Aloysius Brady, a patient of Dr. Bogart's.<br><br>Despite his Irish-sounding name, Bill Brady was a Jewish theatrical producer. At a time when New York society referred to Jews by such code references as NOKD (Not Our Kind, Darling) and restrictive covenants barred "Hebrews" from certain city neighborhoods, the Bogarts displayed few of the standard social biases. Maud was uncomfortable with Jews, but she considered herself a freethinker and a realist. One had to get along with all sorts of people these days. Belmont liked the idea of befriending a man who had managed two undisputed heavyweight champions, James Corbett and James Jeffries, bankrolled touring companies, married the glamorous actress Grace George, and owned the Playhouse Theater on 48th Street. Brady's son, Bill Jr., was an occasional houseguest and honorary gang member; more often he and Humphrey formed their own mini-gang back in the city, where they checked out Sarah Bernhardt and W. C. Fields at the Palace, broke up at the antics of Chaplin and Keaton, and gazed approvingly at the manly images of John Barrymore and Francis X. Bushman in nickelodeons. Bill Sr. had little use for movies-he told the boys they were a passing fad, full of exaggerated gestures by overemoting hambones. He was fond of quoting the director Marshall Neilan: "The sooner the stage people who have come into pictures get out, the better for the pictures."</p><h2>How to See: Visual Adventures in a World God Never Made</h2><p><p><strong>A new edition of George Nelson's classic guide to visual appreciation, released on the fortieth anniversary of its original publication</strong></p><p>Originally published in 1977 by iconic American furniture manufacturer Herman Miller, George Nelson's critically acclaimed manifesto on how to recognize, evaluate, and understand the objects and landscape of the man-made world has influenced generations of design professionals, students, and aficionados.

Specifically, attention is focused upon the importance of previously unpublished texts in reconstructing the history of early Christianity. Some say there is little or nothing of interest in the remaining fragments; others insist that they are of monumental importance. By far the largest cache of these fragments is the one discovered in Qumran cave 4, from which authors Eisenman (Middle East religions, California State Univ.-Long Beach) and Wise (Near Eastern languages and civilization, Univ. of Chicago) have reconstructed 50 texts. For each text, they have provided a transcription into modern Hebrew characters, a translation, and commentary on the text's significance. Significantly, these documents indicate a close relationship between the Zealot Qumran community and the Jewish Christian community under the leadership of James, the brother of Jesus. While the authors must be given due credit for making more of the scroll material available, their conclusions are tentative.

From <i>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</i> onwards the principal films of this period were characterized by two influences: literary Expressionism, and the innovations of the theatre directors of this period, in particular Max Reinhardt. This book demonstrates the connection between German Romanticism and the cinema through Expressionist writings. It discusses the influence of the theatre: the handling of crowds; the use of different levels, and of selective lighting on a predominately dark stage; the reliance on formalized gesture; the innovation of the intimate theatre. Against this background the principal films of the period are examined in detail. The author explains the key critical concepts of the time, and surveys not only the work of the great directors, such as Fritz Lang and F. W. Murnau, but also the contribution of their writers, cameramen, and designers. As <i>The Times Literary Supplement</i> wrote, 'Mme. Eisner is first and foremost a film critic, and one of the best in the world. She has all the necessary gifts.' And it described the original French edition of this book as 'one of the very few classics of writing on the film and arguably the best book on the cinema yet written.'</p><p>In 1919, &#34;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&#34; took the world by storm, at once demonstrating that the cinema was capable of unprecedented sophistication and popularizing the horror movie. Eisner&#39;s classic study covers the history of &#34;Caligari&#34; and the genre it inspired: the German Expressionist Film. Covering the breadth of German Expressionism, Eisner introduces and analyzes some of the greatest films of all time, including &#34;Nosferatu,&#34; &#34;The Last Laugh&#34; and &#34;Metropolis,&#34; while describing the careers of the magnificent directors who worked within the genre: G.W. Pabst, F.W. Murnau and Fritz Lang.Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Another Marvelous Thing</h2><p>Eight connected stories recount the temporary, eventful affair of Billy DeLielle and Frank Clemons and Billy&#39;s gradual achievement of confidence and openness, especially with and within her marriage</p><p>Laurie Colwin is the author of five novels: <i>Happy All the Time, Family Happiness, Goodbye Without Leaving, Shine On, Bright and Dangerous Object, </i>and <i>A Big Storm Knocked It Over;</i> three collections of short stories: <i>Passion and Affect, Another Marvelous Thing, </i>and<i> The Lone Pilgrim;</i> and two collections of essays: <i>Home Cooking</i> and <i>More Home Cooking.</i> She died in 1992.In her deceptively simple, witty style, Colwin (Happy All the Time, Family Happiness continues to write with perception about the bliss and pain of people in love. Her protagonists in these eight linked stories are Josephine (Billy) Delielle and Francis Clemens, both intelligent achievers happily married to their respective spouses, who fall into an unlikely but tender affair when they meet in the offices of the highbrow journal to which they both contribute articles on economics. Billy is young, sloppy, often grumpy, unsentimental, determinedly minimalist in her tastes in food and clothing. Francis is older, sophisticated, urbane, committed to neatness and routine. The stories depict some of the same events told from their differing points of view; despite passion and familiarity, each discovers the essential unknowableness of the other. Both know the relationship will have to end, but the ache of parting is ameliorated for Billy by the consolidation of her marriage through the birth of a baby. Billy and Francis are somewhat improbable as lovers, and Colwin studs the text with too many pithy apothegms about the indelible effects of a love affair, but there are many moments in this slim volume when the reader is touched and moved.

Both struggle to maintain their integrity and find happiness in the face of a competitive marriage market. The basis of the Columbia film, starring Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant.</p><p>Though not the first novel she wrote, <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> was the first Jane Austen published. Though she initially called it <i>Elinor and Marianne</i>, Austen jettisoned both the title and the epistolary mode in which it was originally written, but kept the essential theme: the necessity of finding a workable middle ground between passion and reason. The story revolves around the Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne. Whereas the former is a sensible, rational creature, her younger sister is wildly romantic--a characteristic that offers Austen plenty of scope for both satire and compassion. Commenting on Edward Ferrars, a potential suitor for Elinor's hand, Marianne admits that while she "loves him tenderly," she finds him disappointing as a possible lover for her sister: <blockquote> Oh! Mama, how spiritless, how tame was Edward's manner in reading to us last night! I felt for my sister most severely. Yet she bore it with so much composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it. I could hardly keep my seat. To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, such dreadful indifference! </blockquote> Soon however, Marianne meets a man who measures up to her ideal: Mr. Willoughby, a new neighbor. So swept away by passion is Marianne that her behavior begins to border on the scandalous. Then Willoughby abandons her; meanwhile, Elinor's growing affection for Edward suffers a check when he admits he is secretly engaged to a childhood sweetheart. How each of the sisters reacts to their romantic misfortunes, and the lessons they draw before coming finally to the requisite happy ending forms the heart of the novel. Though Marianne's disregard for social conventions and willingness to consider the world well-lost for love may appeal to modern readers, it is Elinor whom Austen herself most evidently admired; a truly happy marriage, she shows us, exists only where sense and sensibility meet and mix in proper measure. <i>--Alix Wilber</i>Jane Austen&#39;s first published novel introduced many of the themes which would dominate Austen&#39;s future work.

It is now recognized as one of the finest works of twentieth century fiction.For a quarter of a century, Italian and foreign scholars were denied access to the reclusive writer's paper until,following a meeting with Lampedusa's adopted son, David Gilmour succeeded in gaining permission to work in the writer's last home in Sicily.There, and in the nearby ruin of the Palazzo Lampedusa,he found many letters,diaries,notebooks, and photographs which had not seen the light of day since Lampedusa's death.David Gilmour is the author of many works of literary and political history, including "The Long Recessional: The Imperial Life of Rudyard Kipling" and "The Last Leopard: A Life of Giuseppe di Lampedusa," He lives in Edinburgh. <br></p><h2>Fire in the Steppe</h2><p>Close on the heels of the magnificent With Fire and Sword and The Deluge, comes this impassioned tale of love, war, heroism, treason and betrayal, with which the great classic Trilogy of Poland's most popular 19th century writer is brought to an end. Fire in the Steppe is the final book of Sienkiewicz's literary masterpiece which grips and enthralls just as powerfully today as it did when it was first published in Polish in 1883-1889. It is an epic tale of love and adventure set in the savage wilderness of Poland's eastern borderlands in the 17th century, and it is also the most realistic of Sienkiewicz's novels. The Trilogy's most memorable heroes, Pan Zagloba and Pan Volodyovski, are joined here by the unforgettable Basia, whose own adventures ring with strength, courage and determination against the bloody background of raids, border battles, and invasion by the awesome armies of the Turkish Empire in 1672.<br>Told by a master storyteller who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1905, Fire in the Steppe concludes the stories of the Trilogy's fabulous heroines and heroes who live, love and die in these pages of Poland's most enduring epic. As in the first two books, it is a masterful blend of history and imagination in which the East and the West of their era confront each other in an all-out battle, and a handful of devoted men and women makes a heroic stand. Foremost among them is Pan Volodyovski, the Little Knight of The Deluge and With Fire and Sword, and the brave, loving Basia, who rides to war beside him and overcomes terrifying dangers of her own. The inimitable Pan Zagloba, one of literature's most successfully drawn comic anti-heroes, lives, drinks, orates, and flourishes beside them along with a new cast of hard-riding border knights, ruthless villains, and devoted soldiers. Chief among them is the indomitable Basia who brings love to Pan Volodyovski and destruction to a dangerous abductor; the tragic Eva and her brother Adam whose trust and caring bring them to disaster; the driven and ambitious Azia Mellehovitch whose terrible end is the bloodiest and most horrifying in Europe's 19th century literature; and dozens of others.<br>As in all three novels of the Trilogy, Fire in the Steppe dazzles with a gallery of kings, sultans, generals, magnates, Turkish janissaries, merciless bandits, brave soldiers, and other fictional and historical figures who created the era in which this book is set. Rich in action, drama, humor, cruelty and heroism, they are as thrilling and absorbing today as in their own time. First put into English from a Russian text more than 100 years ago, Fire in the Steppe comes brilliantly back to life in this rich new adaptation for the modern reader directly from Polish, and it illuminates the hopes, history and ethnic memory of the Polish people, along with all those other newly liberated nations who live in Eastern Europe.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: PolishFirst published in 1887, this lengthy saga completes Sienkiewicz's populist trilogy (after With Fire and Sword and The Deluge ), which Kuniczak's convincing translation brings to life for the contemporary reader. The Polish people's struggle against Cossacks, Tartars and Turks in the 1670s prefigures modern Poland's quest for nationhood in this installment of the rousing epic of love, war, adventure and madness. Basia, the gutsy, bright, determined heroine, who chases bandits on horseback, riding a man's saddle, almost steals the show from her Hamlet-like husband, Col. Pan Vol od yov ski. A master of robust, old-fashioned realism, Sienkiewicz mixes fictional characters, like his boisterous villain, the shrewd old knight Pan Zagloba, with historical figures like Jan Sobieski, the careworn Grand Hetman of Poland, nemesis of the Turks and savior of Christendom at Vienna. Sienkiewicz's fierce, larger-than-life characters unself-consciously stride across the stage of history. His portrayal of the Polish Commonwealth averting anarchy and pulling together holds a timeless message of hope. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Ourselves: Our Souls and Bodies (Charlotte Mason&#39;s Original Homeschooling Series)</h2><p>Ourselves, the fourth volume of Charlotte Mason&#39;s Classic Homeschooling Series, is a character curriculum book written directly to children.

Self-Direction is an in-depth discussion of the conscience and virtues such as temperance, chastity, fortitude, and prudence; the will and self-control; and the soul and its capacities, such as prayer, thanksgiving, faith, and praise. Charlotte Mason was a late nineteenth-century British educator whose ideas were far ahead of her time. She believed that children are born persons worthy of respect, rather than blank slates, and that it was better to feed their growing minds with living literature and vital ideas and knowledge, rather than dry facts and knowledge filtered and pre-digested by the teacher. Her method of education, still used by some private schools and many homeschooling families, is gentle and flexible, especially with younger children, and includes first-hand exposure to great and noble ideas through books in each school subject, conveying wonder and arousing curiosity, and through reflection upon great art, music, and poetry; nature observation as the primary means of early science teaching; use of manipulatives and real-life application to understand mathematical concepts and learning to reason, rather than rote memorization and working endless sums; and an emphasis on character and on cultivating and maintaining good personal habits.

Written in the late 1960s&#x2014;the decade during which Fernand Braudel was also atwork on his monumental <b>Civilization and Capitalism</b>&#x2014;the manuscript was set aside on the death of the author&#x2019;s longtime friend and editor, Albert Skira. <br><br>The magnificent text begins with the history of the Mediterranean seabed itself&#x2014;the layers of clay, sand, and limestone from which the Egyptians carved their ancient tombs and with which the megalithic temples in Malta were built. What follows is the epic story of how the Phoenicians, the Etruscans, the Greeks and Romans, and the great river civilizations of Mesopotamia and Egypt struggled and thrived in this demanding but gloriously beautiful world bordered and shaped by the Mediterranean.<br><br>With its extraordinary depth and range of knowledge, Braudel&#x2019;s superb history&#x2014;expertly annotated to reflect recent archaeological discoveries&#x2014;brings to life as never before the beginnings of Western culture.</p><p>Fernand Braudel's <i>Memory and the Mediterranean</i>is a panoramic and singular history, a comprehensive synthesis, of that region from pre-historic times to the beginning of the Byzantine Empire. Braudel's concerns are not the usual turning points such as battles and political upheaval. Instead, he focuses on regional and sub-regional vicissitudes (climate, topography, geologic cataclysms, the very currents of the sea itself) and their legacies, especially commerce, to trace the reasons behind the risings and falls of the greater Mediterranean's scores of ancient cultures. What, for example, were the ramifications of Egypt's lack of forests? How did the discovery of bitumen and the development of concrete affect, respectively, the Phoenicians and the Romans? <i>Memory and the Mediterranean</i>is complex and demanding but in the end, rewarding. Its point of view is at once Olympian, humble, and richly commonsensical. <i>--H. O'Billovitch</i>&#x201c;A splendid book. . . .

Highly evolved, the cats share an almost telepathic bond with their minders, or Cat Persons&#x2014;until, suddenly, there is no &#x201c;almost&#x201d; about it, and a particular Barque Cat, Chester, learns to exchange thoughts with his human friend, Jubal. Other cats soon gain the same ability.&nbsp; <br> <br>Behind the seeming miracle is a mysterious cat named Pshaw-Ra, who possesses knowledge and technology far beyond anything the Barque Cats&#x2014;or their humans&#x2014;have ever seen. When fear of a virulent plague leads the government first to quarantine and then to kill all animals suspected of infection, Pshaw-Ra&#x2014;with the help of Chester, Jubal, and the crew of the starship <i>Ranzo</i>&#x2014;activates a &#x201c;mousehole&#x201d; in space that carries the refugees to a place of safety: Pshaw-Ra&#x2019;s home planet of Mau, where godlike cats are worshiped by human slaves.&nbsp; <br> <br>But Pshaw-Ra&#x2019;s actions are less noble than they appear. The scheming cat plans to mate the Barque Cats with his own feline stock, creating a hybrid race of superior cats&#x2014;a race destined to conquer the universe. Yet right from the start, his plans go awry.<br><br>For one thing, there&#x2019;s a new queen on Mau: Pshaw-Ra&#x2019;s daughter Nefure, a spoiled brat&#x2014;er, cat&#x2014;with a temper as short as her attention span. Pshaw-Ra&#x2019;s other daughter, the rightful queen Renpet, is exiled, running for her life in the only direction available to her&#x2014;down into the vast catacombs beneath the Mauan desert. Far from receiving the hero&#x2019;s welcome he expected, Pshaw-Ra must use every bit of his considerable cleverness just to survive.<br> <br>Meanwhile, as usual, Chester and Jubal stumble right into the middle of things, in the process uncovering the lost secrets of the Mauan civilization. But that&#x2019;s not all they uncover. In the forgotten catacombs deep below the Mauan capital, something has awakened. Something as old as the universe.

But thanks to his daring, his farsightedness, his willingness to spend month after solitary month in alien space cleverly tricking passing ships into unwitting participation in his master plan, his race would be saved. And so, more or less, would the remnant of the once-proud Barque Cats, now beaten and broken, bewildered by the betrayal that had befallen them at the hands of those they had once loved and served. It had been a useful object lesson that would make them, Pshaw-Ra thought, much more amenable to the plans he had in store for them.<br><br>Unfortunately, he had been obliged to accept the assistance of a crew of cat-friendly humans in transporting his cargo. He didn't see them as a major obstacle. In time they were bound to acquiesce to their place in the feline scheme of things.<br><br>Chortling behind his whiskers, Pshaw-Ra steered his pyramid craft to land upon the sands of his beloved homeworld. "Go, now," he said with uncharacteristic thoughtfulness to his recently recruited assistant, the only cat among his cargo he thought might cause him any difficulty. "Be with your boy. He is no doubt frightened and will need you to comfort him."<br><br>The half-grown kitten, whose long black coat with white chest and paws resembled an antique version of male human formal dress, flicked his fluffy tail, turned around twice to look at the hieroglyphic controls he was still far too ignorant to understand, and bounded back down the cat-sized corridor leading from the pyramid ship's nose cone into the larger portion of the ship.<br><br>Once the youngster left, Pshaw-Ra activated his communication device and announced his imminent arrival to his planet's people and especially to his queen. "Bring healers and groomers, bring the eligible queens and virile toms. Bring the most biddable and best socialized servants that they may choose among the new ones those most worthy of honor. For my part I bring kitten-capable breeders of great size, many toes, and somewhat regrettable furriness. Also, for my queen, delectable fishy treats."<br><br>He didn't listen for a response before darting out to wait for the triumphal procession that would escort him and his prizes through the city, according him a hero's welcome.<br><br>CHESTER, AS PYRAMID SHIP LANDS ON PLANET MAU<br><br>Entering the atmosphere of Pshaw-Ra's planet, it occurred to me that while we Barque Cats had been preoccupied with escaping death in the labs of Galipolis, perhaps we should have spared a thought for where we were going afterward.<br><br>Because now, here we were and there was no going back.<br><br>Our host, the tawny short-haired big-eared Pshaw-Ra, pilot of the pyramid ship, was the only one among us who knew anything about this mysterious world. And he had been far too busy smiling into his long black whiskers to provide a narrative preview of the place that he had promised would be our new home. All he had confided in me was that cats here were very advanced, worshipped as gods, and were bent on universal domination.<br><br>That was fine for him. Most of the other feline passengers who came with us were still in a state of shock from recent events. In the past weeks my race, including my mother and two of my brothers, had gone from being valued crew members--guardians of their ships' safety and beloved fur-coated surrogate children of their human crewmates--to being labeled the vectors of an unknown disease, incarcerated in dirty cages in a crowded laboratory, and threatened with mass extinction. Several Barque Cats, it was rumored, had already been sacrificed on the altar of scientific inquiry, and the others feared they would soon follow.<br><br>Then Pshaw-Ra decided that we two, who were traveling together at that time, should rescue them, not because he was such a benevolent cat but because (a) we fit in with his plans for the previously mentioned universal domination, (b) it was the fault of him and his accursed kefer-ka, the delicious keka bugs we all loved to eat, that we were mistakenly thought to have a disease in the first place, and (c) Jubal and I wouldn't have stood for any other course of action.<br><br>But once we were inside the ship, and the other cats had time to absorb the fact that they were no longer in cramped dirty cages in a strange place, but were now in cramped quarters, rapidly getting dirty, aboard strange space vessels, they immediately wanted to find something to hide under or to attack, each according to his or her nature. Desperation clawed every available surface, including some human ones, desolation yowled in ear-splitting decibels throughout the ship, despair shed carpets of hair that floated through the air as if fur could bond with oxygen. My fellow cats--cats who had saved a thousand ships (okay, maybe a slight exaggeration, but LOTS of ships)--were thoroughly bedraggled, bewildered, and frustrated.<br><br>Fortunately, thanks to Pshaw-Ra's mouse hole, a cat-created shortcut through space, our trip was not a lengthy one.<br><br>One moment we were fleeing with Galactic Government attracker ships hot on our tails, the next we were surrounded by space empty of other ships, with a sandy colored planet looming ahead. In the far distance were one large star and two smaller ones, but no other ships that we could see. We passed a moon on our left. It seemed to be circled by a bristling cloud of something or other.<br><br>"What's all that?" I asked Pshaw-Ra, indicating the cloud.<br><br>"State-of-the-art terraforming equipment in its day," Pshaw-Ra replied. "It transformed Mau from an uninhabitable chunk of rock to the paradise you see before us."<br><br>I beheld the big planet, most of it a nondescript beige, growing ever larger in the viewport. It continued to fail appearing any more impressive. "Mrrrrumph," I said. "Some paradise."<br><br>"Once great cities and pyramids rose from the sand, but that was in ancient times. Ours was among the earliest colonies to be settled, and when the great colonial corporations decided they could do better elsewhere, they took many of our people to newer worlds. Mau serves its purpose quite adequately for the rest of us, however, at least until we are ready to rule the universe."<br><br>"Rrrrright," I said.<br><br>"Do not judge a planet by its surface, catling," he said sharply. "I have many wonders left to show you."<br><br>"I can hardly wait," I said, cleaning delicately under my tail.<br><br>"Just wait until we are given our heroes' welcome, the choicest tidbits placed before us, the most alluring mates offering themselves, our two-legged slaves providing every imaginable comfort."<br><br>What's that about two-legged slaves, Chester? My boy, Jubal, sent me the thought privately. The short-furred tawny cat couldn't have heard it because he was too busy gloating about the joys of his planet and all he expected to find there.

We were the only creatures remaining on the ship since our escape from the Galactic Government. Once Pshaw-Ra had threaded us through the mouse hole, we had entered the docking bay of the Reuben Ranzo, the ship Jubal had served on. The hatch was opened and the dozens of Barque Cats who had been packed around my boy inside the pyramid ship were released into the Ranzo to join the throng of cats who had been transported to the larger ship after being crammed into two other shuttles.<br><br>This was the result of our daring rescue.<br><br>As soon as we had unloaded our passengers into the Ranzo, Pshaw-Ra launched the pyramid ship into space once more, leading the way to his planet. "Why do they call your planet Mau?" I asked Pshaw-Ra.<br><br>"They didn't call it Mau, we did. The humans named it Bubastis, but that's not a word easily spoken by their gods--namely us--so they had to change it," Pshaw-Ra replied.<br><br>Pshaw-Ra dismissed me shortly before we landed so that I could be with Jubal. Though I was somewhat surprised by the tawny cat's consideration, I was quick to take advantage of it.<br><br>I bounded down the catwalk leading from the bridge in the nose of the pyramid cone, leaped onto the deck and made for the small ship's tiny docking bay to share first impressions with my boy.<br><br>I sprang onto Jubal's knees shortly before we landed, and my boy unstrapped himself from his seat.<br><br>The Ranzo landed beside us.

We all had long beautiful fur, being descended from a feline race once known for some arcane reason as "Maine coon."<br><br>"How would you know where you were out there, away from the river?"

Five months later and still 100 miles from land, their ship, <i>Endurance</i>, became trapped. The expedition survived an Antarctic winter in the icebound ship, then, after <i>Endurance</i> sank, five months camped on the ice followed by a perilous boat journey through storms and icebergs to remote and unvisited Elephnat Island, 600 miles from Cape Horn. From there, their only hope was for someone to fetch help. In a dramatic climax to this amazing survival story, Shackleton and five others navigated 800 miles of the treacherous open ocean in a 20-foot boat and then hiked across the unmapped, glacier-strewn interior of South Georgia Island to a whaling station. In August 1916, 19 months after <i>Endurance </i>first became icebound, Shackleton led a rescue party back to Elephant Island for his men.<br>Jennifer Armstrong narrates these almost unbelievable events with vigor, an eye for detail, and an appreciation of the marvelous leadership of Ernest Shackleton, who brought home every one of his men alive. With them survived a remarkable archive of photographs of the expedition, more than forty of which are reproduced here.</p><p>The harrowing survival story of English explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton and the ill-fated <i>Endurance</i> has intrigued people since the 1914 expedition--spurring astounding books such as <i>Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage</i> and <i>The Endurance: Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic Expedition</i>. As Shackleton and 27 sailors attempted to cross the frozen Antarctic continent from one side to the other, they were trapped in an ice pack, lost their ship to the icy depths, survived an Antarctic winter, escaped attacks from sea lions, and traversed 600 treacherous miles to the uninhabited Elephant Island. Leaving 22 men behind, Shackleton and five others sailed 800 miles across the southern Atlantic Ocean in a 20-foot open boat to tiny South George Island, where they hiked across unmapped mountains to a whaling station. In 1916, 19 months after the <i>Endurance</i> became icebound, Shackleton led a rescue party back to retrieve his men. Remarkably, every crew member survived.<p> Jennifer Armstrong, the award-winning author of <i>Black-Eyed Susan</i> and <i>The Dreams of Mairhe Mehan</i>, brings the unbelievable journey to life with delicious details: how a handsome young stowaway was discovered too late to cast him off; how the ship itself would become frost-white, looking like "another species of sparkling white iceberg as it nosed its way through the pack;" and how the ice-pack-dwelling Emperor penguins seemed to enjoy the banjo music of crew member Leonard Hussey. The true-to-life story is as thrilling as they come, and Armstrong's lively, crystal-clear writing style is just as compelling. More than 40 photographs of the expedition populate this inspiring nonfiction adventure story that young readers will devour from cover to cover.

On Christmas Eve in 1818, in a small Austrian town, Father Mohr's church organ broke down. In compelling prose, Hodges recounts the young priest's struggle to write a poem that would bring the beauty of the Christ Child's humble, but sacred birth night to a congregation that expected to celebrate with music. Franz Gruber, a local schoolmaster, wrote a simple tune to accompany the words. With its creators all but forgotten, "Silent Night" eventually became an international favorite. Hodges includes stories about wartime enemies who forgot their hatred and joined together, sometimes across enemy lines, to share a few verses of the song. Full-page watercolor illustrations capture quaint mountain village scenes. Glowing shades of gold and brown accentuate faces lifted in harmony, creating feelings of warmth, wonder, and contentment. While very different in its approach and artwork from Granfield's treatment of the subject, Hodges's Silent Night is more versatile and is a better bet for library purchase.<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.The text in this account of how Franz Gruber, the part-time organist, and Father Joseph Mohr, the young priest, happened to compose a charming carol for the parishioners in the Austrian village of Obendorf in 1818 doesn't say that mice got into the organ works; but the crucial illustration shows a small rodent scampering away from the choir.

Born near San Francisco but raised in British Columbia, he returned to the United States as a young man and published his first novel in 1944. For over twenty years he lived in Santa Barbara and wrote mystery novels about the fascinating and changing society of his native state. His works have received awards from the Mystery Writers of America and of Great Britain, and his book <i>The Moving Target</i> was made into the movie <i>Harper</i> in 1966.Chapter 1I drove up to the house on a private road that widened at the summit into a parking apron. When I got out of my car I could look back over the city and see the towers of the mission and the courthouse half submerged in smog. The channel lay on the other side of the ridge, partly enclosed by its broken girdle of islands.The only sound I could hear, apart from the hum of the freeway that I had just left, was the noise of a tennis ball being hit back and forth. The court was at the side of the house, enclosed by high wire mesh. A thick-bodied man in shorts and a linen hat was playing against an agile blond woman. Something about the trapped intensity of their game reminded me of prisoners in an exercise yard.The man lost several points in a row and decided to notice my presence. Turning his back on the woman and the game, he came toward the fence."Are you Lew Archer?"I said I was."You're late for our appointment.""I had some trouble finding your road.""You could have asked anybody in town. Everybody knows where Jack Biemeyer lives. Even the planes coming in use my home as a landmark."I could see why. The house was a sprawling pile of white stucco and red tile, set on the highest point in Santa Teresa. The only things higher were the mountains standing behind the city and a red-tailed hawk circling in the bright October sky.The woman came up behind Biemeyer. She looked much younger than he did. Both her narrow blond head and her pared-down middle-aged body seemed to be hyperconscious of my eyes. Biemeyer didn't introduce us. I told her who I was."I'm Ruth Biemeyer. You must be thirsty, Mr. Archer. I know I am.""We won't go into the hospitality routine," Biemeyer said. "This man is here on business.""I know that. It was my picture that was stolen.""I'll do the talking, Ruth, if you don't mind."He took me into the house, his wife following us at a little distance. The air was pleasantly cool inside, though I could feel the weight of the structure surrounding and hanging over me. It was more like a public building than a house--the kind of place where you go to pay your taxes or get a divorce.We trekked to the far side of a big central room. Biemeyer pointed at a white wall, empty except for a pair of hooks on which he said the picture had been hung.I got out my notebook and ball-point pen. "When was it taken?""Yesterday.""That was when I first noticed that it was missing," the woman said. "But I don't come into this room every day.""Is the picture insured?""Not specifically," Biemeyer said. "Of course everything in the house is covered by some insurance.""Just how valuable is the picture?""It's worth a couple of thousand, maybe.""It's worth a lot more than that," the woman said. "Five or six times that, anyway. Chantry's prices have been appreciating.""I didn't know you'd been keeping track of them," Biemeyer said in a suspicious tone. "Ten or twelve thousand? Is that what you paid for that picture?""I'm not telling you what I paid for it. I bought it with my own money.""Did you have to do it without consulting me? I thought you'd gotten over being hipped on the subject of Chantry." She became very still. "That's an uncalled-for remark. I haven't seen Richard Chantry in thirty years. He had nothing to do with my purchase of the picture.""I hear you saying so, anyway."Ruth Biemeyer gave her husband a quick bright look, as if she had taken a point from him in a harder game than tennis. "You're jealous of a dead man."He let out a mirthless laugh. "That's ridiculous on two counts. I know bloody well I'm not jealous, and I don't believe he's dead."The Biemeyers were talking as though they had forgotten me, but I suspected they hadn't. I was an unwilling referee who let them speak out on their old trouble without the danger that it would lead to something more immediate, like violence. In spite of his age Biemeyer looked and talked like a violent man, and I was getting tired of my passive role."Who is Richard Chantry?"The woman looked at me in surprise. "You mean you've never heard of him?""Most of the world's population have never heard of him," Biemeyer said."That simply isn't true. He was already famous before he disappeared, and he wasn't even out of his twenties."Her tone was nostalgic and affectionate. I looked at her husband's face. It was red with anger, and his eyes were confused. I edged between them, facing his wife."Where did Richard Chantry disappear from?""From here," she said. "From Santa Teresa.""Recently?""No. It was over twenty-five years ago. He simply decided to walk away from it all. He was in search of new horizons, as he said in his farewell statement.""Did he make the statement to you, Mrs. Biemeyer?""Not to me, no. He left a letter that his wife made public. I never saw Richard Chantry again after our early days in Arizona.""It's not for want of trying," her husband said. "You wanted me to retire here because this was Chantry's town. You got me to build a house right next to his house.""That isn't true, Jack. It was your idea to build here. I simply went along with it, and you know it."His face lost its flush and became suddenly pale. There was a stricken look in his eyes, as he realized that his mind had slipped a notch."I don't know anything any more," he said in an old man's voice, and left the room.His wife started after him and then turned back, pausing beside a window. Her face was hard with thought."My husband is a terribly jealous man.""Is that why he sent for me?""He sent for you because I asked him to. I want my picture back. It's the only thing I have of Richard Chantry's."I sat on the arm of a deep chair and reopened my notebook. "Describe it for me, will you?""It's a portrait of a youngish woman, rather conventionalized. The colors are simple and bright, Indian colors. She has yellow hair, a red and black serape. Richard was very much influenced by Indian art in his early period.""Was this an early painting?""I don't really know. The man I bought it from couldn't date it.""How do you know it's genuine?""I think I can tell by looking at it. And the dealer vouched for its authenticity. He was close to Richard back in the Arizona days. He only recently came here to Santa Teresa. His name is Paul Grimes.""Do you have a photograph of the painting?""I haven't, but Mr. Grimes has. I'm sure he'd let you have a look at it. He has a small gallery in the lower town.""I better talk to him first. May I use your phone?" She led me into a room where her husband was sitting at an old rolltop desk. The scarred oak sides of the desk contrasted with the fine teakwood paneling that lined the walls. Biemeyer didn't look around. He was studying an aerial photograph that hung above the desk. It was a picture of the biggest hole in the ground I'd ever seen.He said with nostalgic pride, "That was my copper mine.""I've always hated that picture," his wife said. "I wish you'd take it down.""It bought you this house, Ruth.""Lucky me. Do you mind if Mr. Archer uses the phone?""Yes. I do mind. There ought to be some place in a four-hundred-thousand-dollar building where a man can sit down in peace."He got up abruptly and left the room.chapter 2Ruth Biemeyer leaned on the doorframe, exhibiting the profile of her body. It wasn't young any longer, but tennis and possibly anger had kept it thin and taut."Is your husband always like this?""Not always. He's worried these days.""About the missing picture?""That's part of it.""What's the rest?""It may be connected with the picture, as a matter of fact." She hesitated. "Our daughter, Doris, is an undergraduate at the university and it's brought her into contact with some people we wouldn't normally choose for her. You know how it is.""How old is Doris?""Twenty. She's a sophomore.""Living at home?""Unfortunately not. Doris moved out last month at the start of the fall semester. We got her an apartment in Academia Village on the edge of the campus. I wanted her to stay here, of course, but she said she had a right to her own life-style, just as Jack and I have a right to ours. She's always been very critical of Jack's drinking. Mine, too, if you want the exact truth.""Is Doris into drugs?""I wouldn't say that. Not deeply, anyway." She was silent for a while, imagining her daughter's life, which seemed to frighten her. "I'm not too crazy about some of the people she goes around with.""Anyone in particular?""There's a boy named Fred Johnson, whom she's brought to the house. Actually he's a pretty ancient boy; he must be at least thirty. He's one of those perpetual students who hang around the university because they like the atmosphere, or the pickings.""Do you suspect he could have stolen your picture?""I wouldn't put it that strongly. But he is interested in art. He's a docent at the art museum, and taking college courses in that field. He was familiar with Richard Chantry's name, in fact he seemed quite knowledgeable about him.""Wouldn't that be true of local art students in general?""I suppose so. But Fred Johnson showed unusual interest in the picture.""Can you give me a description of Fred Johnson?""I can try."I opened my notebook again and leaned on the rolltop desk. She sat in the swivel chair facing me."Color of hair?""Reddish blond. He wears his hair quite long. It's already thinning a bit on top. But he compensates for that with his mustache. He has one of those big bristly shoebrush mustaches. His teeth aren't very good. His nose is too long.""What color are his eyes? Blue?""More greenish. It's his eyes that really bother me. He never looks straight at you, at least he didn't at me.""Tall or short?""Medium size. Five foot nine, perhaps. Quite slender. On the whole he isn't bad-looking, if you like the type.""And Doris does?""I'm afraid so. She likes Fred Johnson much too well to suit me.""And Fred liked the missing picture?""He more than liked it. He was fascinated by it. He gave it a lot more attention than he gave my daughter. I sort of got the impression that he came here to visit the picture instead of her.""Did he say anything about it?"She hesitated. "He said something to the effect that it looked like one of Chantry's memory pictures. I asked him just what he meant. He said it was probably one of several Chantrys that hadn't been painted directly from a model, but from memory. He seemed to think that added to its rarity and its value.""Did he mention its value?""He asked me how much I paid for it. I wouldn't tell him&#x2014;that's my own little secret.""I can keep a secret.""So can I." She opened the top drawer of the rolltop desk and brought out a local telephone directory. "You wanted to call Paul Grimes, didn't you? Just don't try to get the price out of him, either. I've sworn him to secrecy."I made a note of the dealer's number and his address in the lower town. Then I called the number. A woman's voice answered, faintly exotic, faintly guttural. She said that Grimes was busy with a client but would be free shortly. I gave her my name and said I would drop in later.Ruth Biemeyer whispered urgently in my free ear, "Don't mention me to her."I hung up. "Who is she?""I believe her name is Paola. She calls herself his secretary. I think their relationship may be more intimate than that.""Where's her accent from?""Arizona. I believe she's part Indian."I glanced up at the picture of the hole that Jack Biemeyer had made in the Arizona landscape. "This seems to be turning out to be an Arizona case. Didn't you say Richard Chantry came from there?""Yes, he did. We all did. But we all ended up here in California."Her voice was flat, betraying no regret for the state she had left nor any particular pleasure with the state she lived in now. She sounded like a disappointed woman."Why did you come to California, Mrs. Biemeyer?""I suppose you're thinking about something my husband said. That this is Dick Chantry's town, or was, and that was why I wanted to settle here.""Is that true?""I suppose there's some truth in it. Dick was the only good painter I ever knew really well. He taught me to see things. And I liked the idea of living in the place where he did his best work. He did it all in seven years, you know, and then he disappeared.""When?""If you want the exact date of his departure, it was July 4, 1950.""Are you sure he went of his own accord? He wasn't murdered, or kidnapped?""He couldn't have been. He left a letter to his wife, remember.""Is she still in town?""Very much so. As a matter of fact you can see her house from our house. It's just across the barranca.""Do you know her?""I used to know Francine quite well, when we were young. She and I were never close, though. I've hardly seen her at all since we moved here. Why?""I'd like to have a look at the letter her husband left behind.""I have a copy. They sell photostats of it at the art museum."She went and got the letter. It was framed in silver. She stood above me reading it to herself. Her lips moved as if she was repeating a litany.She handed it over with some reluctance. It was typewritten except for the signature and dated July 4, 1950, at Santa Teresa.Dear Francine,This is a letter of farewell. It breaks my heart to leave you, but I must. We have often talked about my need to discover new horizons beyond which I may find the light that never was on sea or land. This lovely coast and its history have told me what they had to tell me, as Arizona once did.But as in Arizona the history is shallow and recent, and cannot support the major work that I was born to do. I must seek elsewhere for other roots, a more profound and cavernous darkness, a more searching light. And like Gauguin I have decided that I must seek it alone. For it is not just the physical world I have to explore, but the mines and chambers of my own soul.I take nothing with me but the clothes on my back, my talent, and my memory of you. Please remember me with affection, dear wife, dear friends, and wish me well. I only do what I was born to do.Richard Chantry.</p><h2>The One Year Chronological Bible NLT (One Year Bible: Nlt)</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;NOTE: </strong>Font size of the book is 9.5 Pt<em><br><br>The One Year Chronological Bible</em> is ideal for anyone who wants to take a fresh look at the Bible by reading it in the order the events actually happened. You can read the entire Bible in as little as 15 minutes a day with this One Year Bible, the best selling daily reading Bible brand.</p><p><p>Chronological Bible </p><p> Spiritual leaders of all generations have agreed upon the importance of daily Bible reading as a vital means of growth and maturity. Many Bible readers have wished for a method that would help them with the discipline of a regular, systematic study of God's inspired Word. "The One Year Chronological Bible" not only meets this need but also gives you a perspective you cannot get from a Bible laid out in canonical order. </p><p> What is the canonical order? </p><p> The canonical order is the order in which the books of the Bible are normally arranged. This order groups books of similar content together. The books of the Bible are arranged canonically in the following order: Law (Genesis-Deuteronomy), History (Joshua-Esther), Wisdom Literature (Job-Song of Songs), Prophets (Isaiah-Malachi), Gospels (Matthew-John), early church history (Acts), Pauline Epistles (Romans-Philemon), General Epistles (Hebrews-Jude), and Apocalyptic Literature (Revelation). The canonical order was developed by Jerome, who translated the Bible into Latin in the late fourth century ad. </p><p> Although Jerome's order is logical, it does not clearly represent the order in which the events of the Bible unfolded. For instance, why are the books that record the Israelites' return from captivity (Ezra and Nehemiah) arranged before the prophetic books that predict their exile (Jeremiah and Ezekiel)? Or how do the four accounts of Christ's life fit together? To give you a more historical perspective, the Scriptures in "The One Year Chronological Bible" have been arranged in chronological order. </p><p> What is chronological order? </p><p> Chronological order is the order in which the events occurred in time. In "The One Year Chronological Bible, " all Scripture is arranged according to the time sequence of the events. The return of the Israelites from captivity, therefore, comes after the earlier prophets and Daniel, rather than before them. In addition, all four accounts of Christ's life are woven together, giving a clear picture of Christ's time on earth from birth to his ascension into heaven. </p><p> Furthermore, "The One Year Chronological Bible" divides the entire "New Living Translation" into 365 daily readings.

A masterpiece and a bestseller in France, it is now a major motion picture directed by Julian Schnabel. On 8 December 1995, Jean-Dominique Bauby suffered a massive stroke and slipped into a coma. When he regained consciousness three weeks later, the only muscle left functioning was in his left eyelid although his mind remained as active and alert as it had ever been. He spent most of 1996 writing this book, letter by letter, blinking as an alphabet was repeatedly read out to him. &#39;The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly&#39; was published in France on Thursday 6th March 1997. It was immediately hailed as a masterpiece. And then, three days later, he died. &#39;The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly&#39;, which records Bauby&#39;s lonely existence, is probably the most remarkable book about the triumph of the human spirit, the ability to invent a life for oneself in the most appalling of circumstances, that you will ever read. It has now been made into a captivating film, directed by Julian Schnabel and starring Mathieu Amalric, which was the winner of the award for Best Director at Cannes and nominated for the Palm d&#39;Or.</p><p>We've all got our idiosyncrasies when it comes to writing--a special chair we have to sit in, a certain kind of yellow paper we absolutely must use. To create this tremendously affecting memoir, Jean-Dominique Bauby used the only tool available to him--his left eye--with which he blinked out its short chapters, letter by letter. Two years ago, Bauby, then the 43-year-old editor-in-chief of <i>Elle</i> France, suffered a rare stroke to the brain stem; only his left eye and brain escaped damage. Rather than accept his "locked in" situation as a kind of death, Bauby ignited a fire of the imagination under himself and lived his last days--he died two days after the French publication of this slim volume--spiritually unfettered. In these pages Bauby journeys to exotic places he has and has not been, serving himself delectable gourmet meals along the way (surprise: everything's ripe and nothing burns). In the simplest of terms he describes how it feels to see reflected in a window "the head of a man who seemed to have emerged from a vat of formaldehyde.""Was it Hemingway who defined grace under pressure? No matter who said it, the words have never been more pertinent than in speaking of this heroic book, dictated against the worst imaginable adversities. Although every word cost the author a superhuman effort, the prose is not sickbed telegraphese but rather as light as the sprightliest humor, as pungent as the taste of cooking apricots, as vigorous as the step of a young man setting out on a first date. Read this book and fall back in love with life."<br>-- <b>Edmund White</b><p>"To read this most extraordinary of narratives is to discover the luminosity within a courageous man's mind. Locked into his own world but not locked out of ours, [<b>]Jean-Dominique Bauby[</b>] explores images, memories and an entire landscape of fantasy and love. His incomparable final gift to us is a heartbreaking and yet glorious testament to the wrenching beauty of the human spirit."<br>-- <b>Sherwin B. Nuland, M.D.</b></p><p>"As riveting as a narrative from an explorer of deep space, this communication from a mind imprisoned in an unresponsive body is remarkable for its utter lack of self-pity or sentimentality.

An unforgettable read." <br>-- <b>Andrew Weil</b></p><p>"This heartbreaking story by a uniquely gifted writer is about transforming pain into creativity, human despair into literary miracle." <br>-- <b>Elie Wiesel</b></p></p><h2>Richard M. Nixon: A Life in Full</h2><p>From the late 1940s to the mid-1970s, Richard Nixon was a polarizing figure in American politics, admired for his intelligence, savvy, and strategic skill, and reviled for his shady manner and cutthroat tactics. Conrad Black, whose epic biography of FDR was widely acclaimed as a masterpiece, now separates the good in Nixon&#x2014;his foreign initiatives, some of his domestic policies, and his firm political hand&#x2014;from the sinister, in a book likely to generate enormous attention and controversy.<p> Black believes the hounding of Nixon from office was partly political retribution from a lifetime's worth of enemies and Nixon's misplaced loyalty to unworthy subordinates, and not clearly the consequence of crimes in which he participated. Conrad Black's own recent legal travails, though hardly comparable, have undoubtedly given him an unusual insight into the pressures faced by Nixon in his last two years as president and the first few years of his retirement.</p></p><p><b>Conrad Black </b>is the author the bestselling <i>Franklin Delano Roosevelt: Champion of Freedom</i>. He is the former chairman of Hollinger International Inc. and of the <i>London Daily</i> and <i>Sunday Telegraph</i>, and, with associates, was the controlling shareholder of those newspapers and the <i>Spectator </i>(UK), <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i>, <i>Jerusalem Post</i>, and many other publications. He has been a member of the British House of Lords since 2001. He is a member of the editorial board of the <i>National Interest</i>, and a trustee of the Nixon Center in Washington. Black divides his time between London and Toronto.<p>Reviewed by Joan Hoff</p><p>Right up until he was sentenced last month to six and a half years in prison on mail fraud and obstruction of justice charges, newspaper mogul Conrad Black energetically promoted his new biography of Richard Nixon. Unable to travel -- he had surrendered his passport -- Black remained at his mansion in Palm Beach, Fla., but conversed one afternoon with readers at a London book shop using a video link and a LongPen, a long-distance book-signing device developed by author Margaret Atwood. Asked whether he saw any similarities between himself and Nixon, Black replied that in Nixon's case, "there was in fact a break-in and there was some activity that was not legal" -- whereas in his own case, "there was no illegality." At his Dec. 10 sentencing, he continued to insist on his innocence.</p><p>Be that as it may, Black's deep identification with the 37th president of the United States is obvious throughout his book. It portrays Nixon much as the Canadian-born media tycoon sees himself: as a self-made man of great talent, industry and conservative political principles who is tragically thwarted by liberals and a hostile press.</p><p>For such a doorstop of a book, Richard M. Nixon: A Life in Full contains little new information. It is long on detail and short on critical analysis. While Black consulted Nixon's memoirs and the president's other writings, his account largely relies on what others have already published. It is original only to the degree that Black uses facts gleaned from other authors to cast Nixon in a favorable light. Yet Black is so passionate about the topic and so witty in places that readers with an abundance of time and an abiding interest in Nixon may enjoy it, particularly for its tidbits about Nixon's family life and courtship of his eventual wife, Thelma Catherine ("Pat") Ryan. As a young couple in love, Black tells us, Dick and Pat "led a double life," often escaping the Quaker dowdiness of Whittier, Calif., for the nightclubs and strip joints of Los Angeles. </p><p> Black's scant research in primary sources may reflect Henry Kissinger's advice (noted at the beginning of the book's bibliography) that "Richard Nixon is much better understood reading what he wrote than listening to the idiosyncratic and inconsistent flow of what he said to his subordinates." Kissinger's suggestion that historians should ignore the president's conversations is clearly self-serving, since White House tapes and telephone transcripts show him providing less astute and more sycophantic advice to the president than Black conveys. Black's personal and professional friendship with Kissinger may account for this slanted depiction; both Kissinger and his wife served on the board of the newspaper company, Hollinger International, that Black was convicted of defrauding.</p><p>While this biography contains no fresh information about the major crises Nixon faced during his pre-presidential years -- such as his role on the House Un-American Activities Committee or the slush fund that resulted in his famous 1952 "Checkers" speech -- it does offer a few shrewd insights into his early life and political career. As a youth, Black says, Nixon was an outsider and lacked natural political gifts but nonetheless could relate to ordinary people because he "reminded them of themselves." Until the 1940s, Nixon had no "opportunity to think much about the world, or develop what would prove an historic gift for foreign policy." Yet throughout his political career, Black argues, Nixon tried "to balance . . . liberal and conservative Republicans" and actually "was a force for comparative moderation" who "generally kept clear of the more extreme forms of partisan backbiting." Black also makes a convincing case that Nixon lacked traditional racial prejudice, held anti-segregationist views and made an early commitment to civil rights. </p><p>Roughly half of the book's 1,152 pages are devoted to Nixon's presidency, the subject that suffers most from Black's reliance on secondary sources. His account of Watergate, for example, is out of date because he did not consult recently released tapes. These tapes show that Nixon was more deeply involved with White House Counsel John W. Dean in the cover-up of the Watergate break-in than Dean revealed at the Senate Watergate hearings, where Dean wanted to come across as a reluctant witness and heroic whistleblower. Conversations between Nixon and Dean on March 16, 1973, show them concocting the story that "there was not a scintilla of evidence in the investigation that led anywhere near the White House." Careful review of the new tapes also suggests that Dean's famous warning to Nixon on March 21, 1973, about a "cancer . . . within the presidency" was, in fact, a rehearsed utterance he intended to cite if summoned to testify.</p><p>While Black properly gives Nixon credit for d�tente with the Soviet Union and rapprochement with China, he twists the facts when it comes to the president's Middle Eastern, African and Latin American policies in an effort to portray them as unmitigated successes. Most egregiously, he denies any U.S. involvement in Gen. Augusto Pinochet's 1973 overthrow of Chilean President Salvador Allende, ignoring evidence that Nixon and Kissinger allowed clandestine CIA funding of opposition media, politicians and organizations and that they brought American financial pressure to bear on Allende's democratically elected government. Declassified CIA documents indicate that Kissinger and Nixon, as well as President Gerald Ford, turned a blind eye to Pinochet's human rights violations.</p><p>Pinochet died in December 2006 before he could be tried on charges related to the torture and killing of some 3,000 Chilean citizens -- charges that Black blithely dismisses as "short-term human rights outrages in perturbed conditions." Black concludes that Pinochet was "ultimately good for Chile" and that Allende's overthrow was "another clear-cut Nixon victory." </p><p>Instead of turning this and other questionable foreign policies into triumphs, Black might have better served the president he so admires by concentrating on Nixon's domestic policies. They ranged from desegregation of Southern schools, to federal environmental legislation, expansion of social security benefits and support for civil rights for women and Native Americans. These initiatives, along with Nixon's failed attempts to overhaul welfare and health care, make him the most active Republican reformer in the White House since Theodore Roosevelt. But domestic policy battles are often hard to portray as heroic, and Black short-sightedly insists that Nixon's historical greatness lies in his global diplomacy. </p><p></p><p><br>Copyright 2008, The Washington Post.

Two people can have identical experiences, but one blossoms while the other is depleted. The same can be said for any pair of fired CEOs, unsuccessful political candidates, or rookie supervisors.</p><p>In <i>Crucibles of Leadership</i>, Robert J. Thomas concludes that what matters most is what one makes of experience, particularly the traumatic and often unplanned crucible events that challenge one's identity as a leader. What distinguishes leaders who grow through a crucible experience? Their approach to learning. Like accomplished athletes or artists, they practice as strenuously as they perform. And because the line between performance and practice is often hard to discern, they learn how to practice while they perform.</p><p>But theirs is no ordinary practice. It's a regimen tailored to individual aspirations, motivations, and learning styles--a Personal Learning Strategy. Building on insightful and moving stories told by accomplished leaders, Thomas offers probing self-assessments and innovative tools designed to help you develop your own Personal Learning Strategy.</p><p>Provocative and original, with examples drawn from business and politics as well as from the inner workings of the Mormon Church and the Hell's Angels, Thomas's book will revolutionize the way you think about leadership and learning.</p></p><p><p><b>Robert J. Thomas</b> is Executive Director of Accenture's Institute for High Performance Business and Galvin Professor of Leadership at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.

The skills derived from facing one's own "crucibles" are powerful tools for growing one's business." -- <b>Brad Anderson, Vice Chairman and CEO, Best Buy Co., Inc.</b></p><p>"Thomas displays exceptional understanding of the complex forces at work in any leader's career. <i>Crucibles of Leadership</i> provides a crisp road map to leading more effectively." -- <b>Jeff Wilke, Senior Vice President, Amazon.com</b></p><p>"Robert Thomas has written the organizational playbook for transforming management into leadership.

Now, though, Avalon is suffering from mysterious droughts. Then the very stars begin to lose their light, and it seems that the Lady of the Lake's dire predictions are about to come true. The fate of Avalon now rests with Tamwyn, a wandering wilderness guide; Elli, an apprentice priestess; and Scree, a young eagleman. One of them is the true heir of Merlin, the only person who can save Avalon . . . and one of them is the dreaded child of the Dark Prophecy, fated to destroy it.<br> As in his acclaimed epic The Lost Years of Merlin, T. A. Barron has created a radiant, richly imagined world, full of high adventure and un-forgettable characters.</p><p>T.A. Barron is the award-winning author of fantasy novels such as <i>The Lost Years of Merlin</i> epic&#x2014;soon to be a major motion picture. He serves on a variety of environmental and educational boards including The Nature Conservancy and The Land and Water Fund of the Rockies, and is the founder of a national award for heroic children. Following a life-changing decision to leave a successful business career to write full-time in 1990, Barron has written seventeen books, but is happiest when on the mountain trails with his wife, Currie, and their five children.<p> </p>Enter a world of magical delights with a cadre of characters ranging from fairies and tree spirits to an eagle-man with a startling screech. Narrator Richard Easton portrays them all with a range of vocal expression worthy of an epic tale. Listeners are transported to the realms of Avalon as Easton uses myriad voices to skillfully weave this story of three young people, two boys and a girl, one of whom is the rightful heir of the great wizard Merlin. Combining the best in fantasy and adventure, Barron's book is also a mystery because another of the trio is the dreaded child of the Dark Prophecy, who is preordained to destroy this beautiful world. Easton's recounting builds excitement and wonder for listeners as the three search for the secrets of their interwoven destinies.

He notes, too, a gap in our historical memory of even the immediate past, especially among the young, who tend to confuse celebrity with leadership. Eloquent, firsthand recitations from farmers who are losing their land, their solidarity, and their children to the city or by suicide, contrast starkly with that of an international Wall Street futures dealer, listed in the Forbes 400 register of richest Americans. Observations from a truck driver, a sports columnist, a laid-off steel worker, a striking flight attendant, a Ku Klux Klan member, a Gray Panthers activist and a couple serving time for anti-nuclear demonstrations comprise, along wth a host of others, this portrait of a nation's people riven by conflicting values. Major ad/promo; author tour. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.In the latest of Terkel's fine oral histories, ordinary people reflect on the issues of the 1980sReaganism, greed, farming, race relations, education, and religion. The law-and-order fundamentalist who participated in the sanctuary movement and the police chief's wife who was arrested during an anti-war demonstration help form this collage. The "divide" exists when inner beliefs conflict with public policy; when family members harbor differing views on heartfelt issues; when the ideas of the 1960s are compared with those of the 1980s. How did we get from there to here? Where are we heading? There are no answers here, just very timely and provocative commentary in Terkel's inimitable style. Sondra Brunhumer, Western Michigan Univ.

He examines the current landscape of Mars and discovers evidence that the planet was once home to a lush environment of dense atmo-sphere and flowing rivers, lakes, and oceans. He asks questions, based on growing evidence, that cannot be dismissed: Has Mars ever sustained higher forms of life? How might the secret history of Mars be intertwined with Earth's own past and future?<br><br>In his most riveting and revealing book yet, Hancock points to the intriguing possibility that ancient Martian civilization is communicating with us through the remarkable structures it left behind. Megaliths found on the parched shores of Cydonia, a former Martian ocean, mirror the geometrical conventions of the pyramids at Egypt's Giza necropolis. Especially startling is a Sphinx-like structure depicting a face with distinguishable diadem, teeth, mouth, and Egyptian-style headdress. Might there be a connection between the structures of Egypt and those of Mars?<br><br>Yet, as intriguing as scientists all over the world find the Cydonian discovery, NASA continues to balk at taking a more detailed look at the site and has veiled previous photographs and studies<br><br>in a web of equivocation. In The Mars Mystery, Hancock makes a strong case that NASA is motivated by a lingering Cold War mentality and a fear that evidence of alien life will have destabilizing political, economic, and social consequences. In exploring the traces left by the Martian civilization and the cosmic cataclysm that may have ended it, The Mars Mystery is both an illumination of our ancient past and a warning which we still have time to heed about our ultimate fate.</p><p>Mars holds a special fascination for us, because it is the most Earth-like planet we've yet encountered. As we continue to explore the red planet, geological evidence mounts that long ago water flowed freely across its surface, begging the question: If there was water, was there life? Graham Hancock thinks so. In fact, Hancock, a former journalist and the author of several books, including <i>Fingerprints of the Gods</i>, believes that certain formations on the Martian surface are the remnants of an ancient civilization--one strikingly similar to ancient Egypt--that was destroyed by a cataclysmic deep impact. Further, Hancock claims that NASA's reluctance to give credence to "The Face," "The Pyramids," and other things people see in images of the Martian surface is evidence that the U.S. space agency is motivated by cold war paranoia and mistrust. Hancock seems to be more fair-minded than many NASA critics, stating that, "what we see is a mindset, here, not a conspiracy." And indeed, one is hard-pressed to imagine why NASA isn't agreeing wholeheartedly with Hancock, since his ultimate point is that we should be paying more attention to our planetary neighbors and the skies above, lest we suffer the same fate as the Martians. Hancock raises many intriguing questions in this synthesis of unorthodox Mars theory, but those looking for applications of Ockham's razor had best search elsewhere--Hancock's theories require a leap of faith as surely as NASA's do. <i>--Therese Littleton</i>GRAHAM HANCOCK is a former East African correspondent for The Economist and has traveled around the world writing books and filming movies on archaeological discoveries and their connection to our distant past.

It makes far more sense, he maintains, for Washington to adopt a more restrained foreign policy based on a sound understanding of how nationalism and realism constrain great powers abroad.&nbsp;</p><p>It is widely believed in the West that the United States should spread liberal democracy across the world, foster an open international economy, and build institutions. This policy of remaking the world in America's image is supposed to protect human rights, promote peace, and make the world safe for democracy. But this is not what has happened. Instead, the United States has ended up as a highly militarized state fighting wars that undermine peace, harm human rights, and threaten liberal values at home.

A humble house painter is sent a male penguin by the great Admiral Drake and, thanks to the arrival of a female penguin, soon has twelve penguins living in his house. First published in 1938, <i>Mr. Popper's Penguins </i>has amused and enchanted generations of children and their parents.</p><p>Mr. Popper, when not painting or papering his neighbors' walls, has a persistent penchant for penguins. A decorator by day, he's an intrepid Antarctic explorer by night--at least in his imagination. Mr. Popper resigns himself to quiet evenings at home with his family and his travel books, until one day a mysterious package arrives. Pretty soon the Poppers have a house full of penguins, an ice rink in the basement, and an ever-increasing bill for raw fish and canned shrimp. Time to take this show on the road! <p> The Atwaters wrote this unforgettable tale in 1938, but its timeless charm shows no signs of aging. Children are invited to imagine, dream, and believe that anything is possible. Robert Lawson, illustrator of <i>The Story of Ferdinand</i>, offers delightfully humorous pictures--as integral to this classic as the story itself.

He is best known for writing <em>Mr. Popper's Penguins </em>with his wife, Florence, who finished the novel when he fell ill. Together, they were honored with the 1939 Newbery Honor Award.</p><h2>Johnny Cash: The Autobiography</h2><p>Straightforward, humorous, and packed with wisdom, an intimate portrait by the legendary country music idol details his stormy past, rise to success, future plans, struggles and victories, closest friends including Willie Nelson and Bob Dylan, and the major influences and people that have molded his life. Reissue.</p><p><p>Johnny Cash (1932-2003) was an American icon and country music superstar, a professed man of faith, as well as the author of three books. Cash first sang publicly while in the air force in the early fifties. The youngest person ever chosen for the Country Music Hall of Fame, he was also inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and awarded eleven Grammies in a career that spanned generations. Married to country legend June Carter, Cash performed everywhere from Folsom Prison to the White House, hosted his own television show, appeared in feature films, and in 1996 received the Kennedy Center Lifetime Achievement Award.</p>A humble, happy look back from the man in black. Johnny Cash answers to many names; he's JR to childhood friends and family, John to bandmates, and Johnny to fans. ``Cash'' is the name wife June Carter reserves for ``the star, the egomaniac.'' The star gets plenty of ink here, from the early days at Sun Records--with Elvis, Carl Perkins, and Jerry Lee Lewis--to his current status as a darling of the alternative rock set. But it's the private man who's most compelling and surprisingly complex. Cash writes candidly of his recurring addiction to amphetamines and his concomitant shortcomings as a father, addresses his spirituality without sounding maudlin, and displays genuine humility at his success and very little bitterness at his abandonment by the country music establishment. A more accurate subtitle might be ``The Second Autobiography,'' since this volume covers some of the same ground as Cash's previous work, The Man in Black (1986), but a life so chock full of oddments (he once started a forest fire with an automobile and on another occasion was nearly disemboweled by an ostrich) and renegade stands (he opposed Vietnam, heresy to the nation's blue- collar constituency) easily merits a second look. Organized around the domiciles where he divides his time--homes in Tennessee, Florida, and Jamaica, as well as his tour bus--the book stays grounded in the present, mixing reflections on his 40-year career with a running chronicle of an ongoing tour. This novel approach minimizes the as-told-to blahs that plague many a celebrity autobiography and highlights Cash's wry humor and introspection. With the help of Carr, editor of Country Music magazine, Cash keeps the pace lively until the end, when the roses he throws everyone from grandkids to music biz buddies bog things down. Mostly, though, a pungent, substantive autobiography from one the most iconoclastic talents on the American music scene.

These strange properties cause some people to seek equally strange philosophical theories to explain them. Talbot attempts to link the physical theories with some non-physical experimental results.

Among the subjects explored are poltergeists, the possibility of instantaneous communication across great distances, and the nature of the mind and consciousness. This is an interesting combination of physics, metaphysics, and parapsychology. Harold D.

W. Tozer, but few living today were blessed to sit under his weekly teaching from the pulpit. In this never-before published collection of teachings on 1 Peter, adapted from sermons given to his parishioners, Tozer examines what it means to call oneself a &#x201c;Christian.&#x201d; In his view, to be a recipient of God&#x2019;s salvation is to become &#x201c;the pride of all heaven,&#x201d; indestructible and able to withstand anything and everything that seeks to undermine one&#x2019;s faith. The epistle of 1 Peter was written to a group of just such Christians, to encourage them to live in the center of God&#x2019;s redeeming love. Through Tozer&#x2019;s incomparable teaching and commentary, this ancient letter becomes a fresh and life-infusing admonition for today&#x2019;s Christian!<br></p><p>What makes Christians different from everyone else? Countless misconceptions prevail in our culture, and even in the Church, about what it means to be a Christian&#x2014;not least the erroneous and all-too-common idea that Christians are just people doing their best to clean up their acts. People have misunderstood this concept throughout Church history. The apostle Peter wrote a letter to a group of early Christians to help them understand not only what had happened when they converted, but also how they should live and what they should believe as people who had been born again. In the hands of eminent teacher A. W. Tozer, Peter&#x2019;s first letter of pastoral guidance is as timely and relevant to believers today as it surely was for those Christians living in the first century. Living as a Christian will help you embrace your position in Christ as &#x201c;the pride of all heaven&#x201d; and show you how to live in the center of God&#x2019;s redeeming love, able to withstand anything and everything that would seek to undermine your faith.&nbsp;<b>A.

He was tired and he&#x2019;d been going to take his wife to the pictures. Besides, the first things he&#x2019;d noticed when Parsons brought him into the room were the books in the rack by the fireplace. The titles were enough to give the most level-headed man the jitters, quite enough to make a man anxious where no ground for anxiety existed: Palmer the Poisoner, The Trial of Madeleine Smith, Three Drowned Brides, Famous Trials, Notable British Trials.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you think your reading has been preying on your mind?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m interested in crime,&#x201d; Parsons said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a hobby of mine.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I can see that.&#x201d; Burden wasn&#x2019;t going to sit down if he could avoid it. &#x201c;Look, you can&#x2019;t say your wife&#x2019;s actually missing. You&#x2019;ve been home one and a half hours and she isn&#x2019;t here. That&#x2019;s all. She&#x2019;s probably gone to the pictures. As a matter of fact I&#x2019;m on my way there now with my wife. I expect we&#x2019;ll meet her coming out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Margaret wouldn&#x2019;t do that, Mr. Burden. I know her and you don&#x2019;t. We&#x2019;ve been married nearly six years and in all that time I&#x2019;ve never come home to an empty house.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell you what I&#x2019;ll do. I&#x2019;ll drop in on my way back. But you can bet your bottom dollar she&#x2019;ll be home by then.&#x201d; He started moving toward the door. &#x201c;Look, get on to the station if you like. It won&#x2019;t do any harm.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, I won&#x2019;t do that. It was just with you living down the road and being an inspector. . . .&#x201d;<br><br>And being off duty, Burden thought. If I was a doctor instead of a policeman I&#x2019;d be able to have private patients on the side. I bet he wouldn&#x2019;t be so keen on my services if there was any question of a fee.<br><br>Sitting in the half-empty dark cinema he thought: Well, it is funny. Normal ordinary wives as conventional as Mrs. Parsons, wives who always have a meal ready for their husbands on the dot of six, don&#x2019;t suddenly go off without leaving a note.<br><br>&#x201c;I thought you said this was a good film,&#x201d; he whispered to his wife.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, the critics liked it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, critics,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Another man, that could be it. But Mrs. Parsons? Or it could be an accident. He&#x2019;d been a bit remiss not getting Parsons to phone the station straight away.<br><br>&#x201c;Look, love,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t stand this. You stay and see the end. I&#x2019;ve got to get back to Parsons.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I wish I&#x2019;d married that reporter who was so keen on me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You must be joking,&#x201d; Burden said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;d have stayed out all night putting the paper to bed. Or the editor&#x2019;s secretary.&#x201d; He charged up Tabard Road, then made himself stroll when he got to the Victorian house where Parsons lived. It was all in darkness, the curtains in the big bay downstairs undrawn. The step was whitened, the brass kerb above it polished. Mrs. Parsons must have been a house-proud woman. Must have been? Why not, still was?<br><br>Parsons opened the door before he had a chance to knock. He still looked tidy, neatly dressed in an oldish suit, his tie knotted tight. But his face was greenish gray. It reminded Burden of a drowned face he had once seen on a mortuary slab. They had put the glasses back on the spongy nose to help the girl who had come to identify him.<br><br>&#x201c;She hasn&#x2019;t come back,&#x201d; he said. His voice sounded as if he had a cold coming. But it was probably only fear.<br><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s have a cup of tea,&#x201d; Burden said. &#x201c;Have a cup of tea and talk about it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I keep thinking what could have happened to her. It&#x2019;s so open round here. I suppose it would be, being country.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s those books you read,&#x201d; Burden said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not healthy.&#x201d; He looked again at the shiny paper covers. On the spine of one was a jumble of guns and knives against a blood-red background. &#x201c;Not for a layman,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Can I use your phone?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s in the front room.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get on to the station. There might be something from the hospitals.&#x201d;<br><br>The front room looked as if nobody ever sat in it. With some dismay he noted its polished shabbiness. So far he hadn&#x2019;t seen a stick of furniture that looked less than fifty years old. Burden went into all kinds of houses and he knew antique furniture when he saw it. But this wasn&#x2019;t antique and nobody could have chosen it because it was beautiful or rare. It was just old. Old enough to be cheap, Burden thought, and at the same time young enough to be expensive. The kettle whistled and he heard Parsons fumbling with china in the kitchen. A cup crashed on the floor. It sounded as if they had kept the old concrete floor. It was enough to give anyone the creeps, he thought again, sitting in these high-ceilinged rooms, hearing unexplained inexplicable creaks from the stairs and the cupboard, reading about poison and hangings and blood.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve reported your wife as missing,&#x201d; he said to Parsons. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing from the hospitals.&#x201d;<br><br>Parsons turned on the light in the back room and Burden followed him in. It must have a weak bulb under the parchment lampshade that hung from the center of the ceiling. About sixty watts, he thought. The shade forced all the light down, leaving the ceiling, with its plaster decorations of bulbous fruit, dark and in the corners blotched with deeper shadow. Parsons put the cups down on the sideboard, a vast mahogany thing more like a fantastic wooden house than a piece of furniture, with its tiers and galleries and jutting beaded shelves. Burden sat down in a chair with wooden arms and seat of brown corduroy. The lino struck cold through the thick soles of his shoes.<br><br>&#x201c;Have you any idea at all where your wife could have gone?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been trying to think. I&#x2019;ve been racking my brains. I can&#x2019;t think of anywhere.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What about her friends? Her mother?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Her mother&#x2019;s dead. We haven&#x2019;t got any friends here. We only came here six months ago.&#x201d;<br><br>Burden stirred his tea. Outside it had been close, humid. Here in this thick-walled dark place, he supposed, it must always feel like winter.<br><br>&#x201c;Look,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like to say this, but somebody&#x2019;s bound to ask you. It might as well be me. Could she have gone out with some man? I&#x2019;m sorry, but I had to ask.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course you had to ask. I know, it&#x2019;s all in here.&#x201d; He tapped the bookcase. &#x201c;Just routine inquiries, isn&#x2019;t it? But you&#x2019;re wrong. Not Margaret. It&#x2019;s laughable.&#x201d; He paused, not laughing. &#x201c;Margaret&#x2019;s a good woman. She&#x2019;s a lay preacher at the Wesleyan place down the road.&#x201d;<br><br>No point in pursuing it, Burden thought. Others would ask him, probe his private life whether he liked it or not, if she still hadn&#x2019;t got home when the last train came in and the last bus had rolled into Kingsmarkham garage.<br><br>&#x201c;I suppose you&#x2019;ve looked all over the house?&#x201d; he asked.

Years passed before Eleanor began to discover in herself the qualities of intelligence, compassion, and strength that made her a remarkable woman. In <b>Eleanor</b>, two-time Caldecott Medal winner <b>Barbara Cooney</b> paints a meticulously researched, lushly detailed picture of Eleanor's childhood world--but most importantly, she captures the essence of the little girl whose indomitable spirit would make her one of the greatest and most beloved first ladies of all time. <br>"There are many biographies of Eleanor Roosevelt, but this one is special?Cooney is at her artistic best." --Booklist</p><p>Award-winning author Cooney presents a well-researched and poignant storybook biography of Eleanor Roosevelt&#39;s childhood. The wartime First Lady of the New Deal, who became one of the most beloved Americans for her empathy with the downtrodden, was famously unglamorous and plain in looks, even as a child. Her beautiful and awful mother humiliated the little girl, calling her Granny, &#34;because she is so funny and old-fashioned looking.&#34; Orphaned at nine the girl eventually found her way to confidence, helped initially by a boarding-school headmistress. The book mentions only briefly Roosevelt&#39;s later achievements, so a parent will have to supply a little context for this tale of an ugly duckling who turns into, not a swan, but a fulfilled and happy duck.<b>Barbara Cooney</b> was an&nbsp;American&nbsp;writer and&nbsp;illustrator&nbsp;of over 100&nbsp;children's books, published over sixty years.

As a result, often the people Romans feared most were the "enemies at home," the slaves under their own roofs. Because of this, Roman law decreed that if the head of a household was murdered at home, and the culprit wasn't quickly discovered, his slaves&#x2015;all of them, guilty or not&#x2015;were presumed responsible and were put to death. Without exception. </p><p>When a couple is found dead in their own bedroom and their house burglarized, some of their household slaves know what is about to happen to them. They flee to the Temple of Ceres, which by tradition is respected as a haven for refugees. This is where Flavia Albia comes in. The authorities, under pressure from all sides, need a solution. Albia, a private informer just like her father, Marcus Didius Falco, is asked to solve the murders, in this mystery from Lindsey Davis.</p></p><p><p>LINDSEY DAVIS is the author of <i>The New York Times</i> bestselling series of historical mysteries featuring Marcus Didius Falco. She lives in London.</p><p>1</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Even before I started, I knew I should say no.</p> <p>There are rules for private informers accepting a new case. Never take on clients who cannot pay you. Never do favors for friends. Don&#x2019;t work with relatives. Think carefully about legal work. If, like me, you are a woman, keep clear of men you find attractive.</p> <p>The Aviola inquiry broke every one of those rules, not least because the clients had no money, yet I took it on. Will I never learn?</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>One warm, starry June night in the city of Rome, burglars invaded a ground-floor apartment on the Esquiline Hill. A large quantity of fine domestic silverware was taken, which people assumed was the primary target. The middle-aged couple who rented the fashionable suite had married only recently, which made what happened to them more poignant. After the robbers left, their bodies were found on the marital bed, amid signs of violent struggle. Both had been strangled.</p> <p>The dead couple were wealthy enough to merit an investigation, a privilege that was generally thought too good for the poor, though it was normally available to victims who had left behind influential friends, as was the case here. Inquiries were first assigned to a vigiles officer, Titianus of the Second Cohort. In fairness, Titianus was no more inept than most vigiles. He knew that two plus two made four&#x2014;unless he happened to be preoccupied with watching a good cockfight, when he might inadvertently say five. But he had a decent record of arresting pickpockets in the Market of Livia. For about two hours he even thought that trying to solve a double murder was exciting. Then reality set in.</p> <p>Titianus found it impossible to identify the thief or thieves. After asking around a bit, he turned his attention to the household, declaring that this must be an inside job. Inevitably his gaze fell on the owners&#x2019; freedmen and slaves. The freedmen were mature, articulate and well organized; that was how they had managed to gain their liberty and how they now bamboozled Titianus. The slaves were more vulnerable: younger and naive, or else older and plain dim. Nobody ever said any of them had threatened their master and mistress, but to a law officer in Rome any culprits were better than none and with slaves no real proof was necessary. They could be accused, tortured, prosecuted and executed on simple probability. Titianus put on a clean tunic to look good, then went and announced to his cohort tribune that he had the answer. The slaves did it.</p> <p>The slaves got wind of their plight. They knew the notorious Roman law when a head of household was murdered at home. By instinct the authorities went after the wife, but that was no use if she was dead too. So unless the dead man had another obvious enemy, his slaves fell under suspicion. Whether guilty or not, they were put to death. All of them.</p> <p>The good thing about such systematic capital punishment, occurring in public of course, was that it helped make other slaves, of whom there were hundreds of thousands in Rome, more well behaved. The proportion of masters to slaves was very small, so nobody wanted this big slave population to get the idea of staging a rebellion. In our city it had been decided not to dress slaves in any distinguishing way, because then they might realize the power of their own numbers.</p> <p>Many owners lived in constant fear of slaves turning against them. You cannot batter loyalty into a sullen, captive foreigner and neither can you even guarantee that kindly treatment will gain their gratitude. In Rome, executing slaves who betrayed their masters was therefore extremely popular. At least it was among the slave-owning classes.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>Terrified, and with good reason, some of the accused slaves bolted from the elegant Esquiline house and took refuge a distance away at the Temple of Ceres. By tradition, this monument on the Aventine Hill offered a haven for refugees. They could claim sanctuary, be kept safe and even hope to be fed.</p> <p>In theory, the authorities fostered the great temple&#x2019;s famous role as a focus of liberty and protector of the desperate. However, nobody wants to take fine ideals too far.</p> <p>In a swift, panic-stricken meeting just after dawn, the issue of how to get rid of the fugitives was handed to a magistrate whose duties gave him close connections to the temple. His name was Manlius Faustus, one of that year&#x2019;s plebeian aediles, and I knew him. I liked his methods. He always stayed calm.</p> <p>Charged with solving the problem, Faustus solemnly agreed with the Temple of Ceres authorities that it was important to take the correct action. This situation could easily turn ugly. They wanted to avoid censure. The public were shouting for a solution, preferably bloody. The <i>Daily Gazette</i> had already asked for a quotable comment and was about to feature the story in its scandal section; publication would fire lurid Forum gossip. The unseen eye of the emperor was probably on the Temple. Faustus had been handed a rather hot platter here.</p> <p>As this dutiful man tried to come up with ideas, he walked to a bar called the Stargazer. There, while he pondered the meager choice for breakfast, he ran into me.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Copyright � 2014 by Lindsey Davis</p></p><h2>Avatar: A Confidential Report on the Biological and Social History of Pandora</h2><p><p>A field guide to Pandora&#x2014;the mesmerizing world of James Cameron's <em>Avatar</em>.</p><p>Four years in the making&#x2014;and 15 years since its conception&#x2014;<em>Avatar</em> is a live action film with a new generation of special effects, delivering a fully immersive cinematic experience of a new kind, where the revolutionary technology invented to make the film disappears into the emotion of the characters and the sweep of the story.</p><p>In <em>Avatar: A Confidential Report on the Biological and Social History of Pandora</em> we are introduced to Pandora&#x2014;a pristine and beautiful moon in a distant solar system&#x2014;its exotic ecosystems, and the indigenous race called the Na'vi.

Five pieces describe road trips; the satisfying title tale recalls a bygone time in which a beautiful blonde model might pick up a hitchhiker packing Benzedrine. Kerouac offers observations on the Beat Generation, tying it to beatitude and lamenting its appropriation by the "Hollywood borscht circuit." His advice on writing is both incisively amusing ("Try never get drunk outside yr own house") and perhaps unhelpful to the less talented ("sketching language is . . . blowing" like a jazz musician). Most interesting is his elegant and persuasive defense of his novel The Subterraneans in 1963 after it was banned in Italy. His 1969 reflection on the radicals of the era is startling: though critical of the "Establishment," he castigates young leftists and praises the American system that allowed him to travel wherever he wanted. But some other writings, like impressionistic sketches of Manhattan and articles on baseball, are strictly for fans. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Call of Cthulhu and Other Dark Tales (Barnes &amp; Noble Library of Essential Reading)</h2><p><p>&#x201c;The twentieth century&#x2019;s greatest practitioner of the classic horror tale&#x201d; &#x2013; Stephen King about H. P. Lovecraft</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>H. P. Lovecraft&#x2019;s</b> fiction reveals a universe that is vaster, darker, and stranger than anything previously imagined. His &#x201c;cosmic horror&#x201d; reflects a peculiarly modern philosophical belief system in which human beings are regarded as insignificant in light of the vastness of time and space. The especially Lovecraftian twist on this apocalyptic premise is that it is alien forces and powers at work in the universe that possess the potential for the ultimate destruction of mankind.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reprinted here are many of Lovecraft&#x2019;s most famous works, including &#x201c;The Call of Cthulhu&#x201d; (1928), &#x201c;The Dunwich Horror&#x201d; (1929), and &#x201c;The Shadow Over Innsmouth&#x201d; (1936).&nbsp; These stories will introduce readers to Lovecraft&#x2019;s pantheon of &#x201c;gods,&#x201d; his characteristic themes, his fictitious New England geography and, of course, the <i>Necronomicon</i>, Lovecraft&#x2019;s famous invented book of occult secrets.</p></p><p><p><b>Howard Phillips Lovecraft</b> was born on August 20, 1890, in Providence, Rhode Island.&nbsp; When Lovecraft was three, his father was admitted to an insane asylum, and by the time he was eight he suffered his own &#x201c;near-breakdown.&#x201d;&nbsp; The year before that, he had begun writing short horror tales.</p><p>The horror, science fiction, and fantasy writing of American author <b>H. P. Lovecraft</b> attracted little attention during his lifetime.&nbsp; Indeed, outside of a small circle of admirers and readers of the pulp magazine <i>Weird Tales</i> in the 1920s and 30s, few had ever heard of him.&nbsp; And yet today he is recognized as one of the most important horror authors of the twentieth century, with authors from Stephen King to Clive Barker to Neil Gaiman acknowledging his influence on them.&nbsp; Much of Lovecraft&#x2019;s appeal to contemporary readers arguably derives from his pioneering of &#x201c;cosmic horror,&#x201d; a peculiarly modern philosophical belief system in which there is no controlling God or deity in charge of the universe, and human beings, regarded as especially insignificant in light of the vastness of time and space, are always just a hairbreadth away from being wiped out.&nbsp; The especially Lovecraftian twist on this apocalyptic premise is that it is not human arrogance or carelessness that is at fault; it is not atomic weapons or global warming that threatens human beings&#x2014;we just aren&#x2019;t that important.&nbsp; It is rather alien forces and powers at work in the universe, including Lovecraft&#x2019;s &#x201c;Elder Gods&#x201d; and &#x201c;Great Old Ones&#x201d; (not actually gods but extraterrestrial monsters with powers far outstripping those of humanity), that possess the potential for the ultimate destruction of mankind.&nbsp; This volume collects together a sampling of Lovecraft&#x2019;s earlier work, along with many selections from his &#x201c;Cthulhu Mythos,&#x201d; his stories that introduce his pantheon of alien &#x201c;gods,&#x201d; including his famous &#x201c;The Call of Cthulhu,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Dunwich Horror,&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Shadow Over Innsmouth.&#x201d;&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Howard Phillips Lovecraft was born on August 20, 1890, in Providence, Rhode Island, a city that becomes the setting for several of this tales.&nbsp; He was the only child of Winfield Scott Lovecraft, a traveling salesman for a silversmith company, and Sarah Susan Phillips Lovecraft, who could trace her ancestry back to colonial New England.&nbsp; In 1893, when Lovecraft was three, his father suffered a psychological breakdown and became delusional while on the road in Chicago and was admitted to Butler Hospital (an insane asylum) in Providence where he died five years later of what was most likely tertiary syphilis&#x2014;it&#x2019;s unclear if Lovecraft ever became aware of the actual nature of his father&#x2019;s illness.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lovecraft, a precocious but sickly child coddled by his overprotective mother, began composing poetry at age six and short horror tales and musings on science at age seven.&nbsp; Under the auspices of his maternal grandfather, the delightfully named Whipple Van Buren Phillips, Lovecraft was introduced to the classics (among them, children&#x2019;s versions of <i>The Iliad</i> and <i>The Odyssey</i>), as well as to Gothic tales of his grandfather&#x2019;s own invention.&nbsp; However, it was Lovecraft&#x2019;s discovery at age eight of the work of Edgar Allan Poe that arguably marks his true entrance into the realm of tales of the uncanny.&nbsp; Later in his life, the works of the Irish fantasist Lord Dunsany and Welsh fantasy writer Arthur Machen would also exercise considerable influence on his artistic development.&nbsp; Lovecraft&#x2019;s formal schooling was limited by ill health&#x2014;to a large extent psychosomatic as he suffered his first &#x201c;near-breakdown&#x201d; in 1898 at age eight&#x2014;but Lovecraft, who never finished high school, compensated for his lack of formal education by his voracious reading and, in the assessment of preeminent Lovecraft scholar S. T. Joshi, became &#x201c;one of the most prodigious autodidacts in modern history.&#x201d;[i]</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lovecraft&#x2019;s entrance into the world of publishing was facilitated by his association with the United Amateur Press Association (UAPA)&#x2014;a relatively small group of amateur journalists who published journals and circulated them among themselves in the 1910s and 1920s.&nbsp; Lovecraft contributed poetry and essays to UAPA journals and published thirteen issues of his own journal, the <i>Conservative&#x2014;</i>a periodical that reflected his own conservative cultural views.&nbsp; His first published story, &#x201c;The Alchemist,&#x201d; appeared in the <i>United Amateur</i> in 1916, but his transition into professional fiction did not occur until 1922 (when he was thirty-one years old) with the publication of &#x201c;Herbert West&#x2014;Reanimator&#x201d; in a crude professional publication called <i>Home Brew</i>.&nbsp; Then, at the urging of colleagues, Lovecraft began to submit his tales to the celebrated pulp magazine <i>Weird Tales</i>, which was founded in 1923 and which included the early work of notable authors such as Ray Bradbury, Fritz Leiber, Henry Kuttner, C. L. Moore, and Theodore Sturgeon.&nbsp; <i>Weird Tales</i> became the principle publication venue for Lovecraft.&nbsp; In the early 1920s, Lovecraft also began to build up an ever-expanding network of correspondents that led to his becoming one of the most prolific letter writers of the twentieth century&#x2014;letters which Joshi speculates may one day be recognized as in fact his greatest achievement.[ii]</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After a curious failed marriage to a Russian Jewish immigrant named Sonia H. Greene (given Lovecraft&#x2019;s anti-Semitism, his marriage to a Jewish woman is surprising) and several years of attempting to subsist in New York through a combination of writing, ghostwriting, and editing the work of others, and unsuccessful stints working for firms including a collection agency and a lamp-testing company, Lovecraft returned in 1926 to Providence, the place of his birth.&nbsp; His mother had died in 1921 as a result of complications from gallbladder surgery, so he moved in with his two maternal aunts.&nbsp; This transition touched off the most fertile period in Lovecraft&#x2019;s creative life&#x2014;in a nine-month period between 1926 and 1927, Lovecraft produced several of his best-known and most celebrated works: &#x201c;The Call of Cthulhu,&#x201d; <i>The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath</i>, <i>The Case of Charles Dexter Ward</i>, and &#x201c;The Color Out of Space.&#x201d;&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Despite his best efforts, however, Lovecraft found it difficult to sell his increasingly lengthy and complicated later work and his revision efforts for others brought in diminishing returns.&nbsp; His last years were lamentably plagued by poverty and hardship.&nbsp; In 1936, he was saddened by the suicide of his correspondent Robert E. Howard, author of the Conan the Barbarian stories, and Lovecraft himself succumbed to cancer of the intestine on March 10, 1937, at the age of forty-seven, having never seen a true book publication of his work.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lovecraft&#x2019;s body of fiction is often divided up into three roughly chronological categories: his early Poe-inspired horror stories (roughly 1905&#x2013;1920), his Lord Dunsany-inspired &#x201c;Dream Cycle&#x201d; stories (1920&#x2013;1927), and then his Cthulhu Mythos (1925&#x2013;1935).&nbsp; As preeminent Lovecraft scholar S. T. Joshi has remarked, Lovecraft initially found in the stories of Edgar Allan Poe a model for both style and plot structure, and his early work, nearly devoid of dialogue, built around narration, and overloaded with adjectives, clearly reflects this influence.[iii]&nbsp; An example of one of Lovecraft&#x2019;s Poe-inspired short horror stories included here is &#x201c;The Terrible Old Man,&#x201d; composed in 1920.&nbsp; In this brief tale, three thieves who intend to loot the home of a strange Old Man get their comeuppance through apparently supernatural means.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 1919, Lovecraft discovered the work of Lord Dunsany, an Irish fantasy writer and dramatist, and for two years after, he did little but write Dunsany imitations.&nbsp; What Lovecraft found so captivating in Dansany&#x2019;s fiction was the &#x201c;remoteness&#x201d; of his fantasylands&#x2014;realms of pure fantasy without connection to the human world.[iv]&nbsp; The stories in Dunsany&#x2019;s first two books, <i>The Gods of Pegana</i> (1905) and <i>Time and the Gods</i> (1906), and in part of his third book, <i>The Sword of Welleran and Other Stories</i> (1908), are set in his invented world of <i>Pegana</i>, complete with its own gods, geography, and history.&nbsp; Dunsany&#x2019;s influence is clearly evident in Lovecraft&#x2019;s stories, including <i>The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath</i> (1926) and "The Silver Key" (1929), set in the Dreamlands, an alternate dimension that can be entered through dreams, as well as in stories set in other worlds such as &#x201c;The Cats of Ulthar&#x201d; (1920), &#x201c;Celepha�s&#x201d; (1920), and &#x201c;The Other Gods&#x201d; (1921).&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Although Lovecraft&#x2019;s Dream Cycle stories include some of his best writing, what he is most well known for are his Cthulhu Mythos, stories set in the contemporary world of twentieth-century America (often in New England), into which Lovecraft introduces monstrous extraterrestrial forces.&nbsp; Most familiar here is this collection&#x2019;s title story, &#x201c;The Call of Cthulhu.&#x201d;&nbsp; Written in the summer of 1926, it was first published in <i>Weird Tales</i> in 1928 and is the only story written by Lovecraft in which the extraterrestrial entity Cthulhu himself appears.&nbsp; The story actually consists of three separate stories linked together by the narrator who discovers the notes of his deceased relative, and it culminates with the characteristically Lovecraftian realization that human beings are not the center of the universe and it is only our ignorance of our true insignificance that keeps us from going mad.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Collected in this volume are stories that tend to fall into the first and third categories of Lovecraft&#x2019;s oeuvre.&nbsp; Observant readers will notice, however, that even in tales written as early as &#x201c;Dagon&#x201d; (1919) and &#x201c;Nyarlathotep&#x201d; (1920), Lovecraft is already beginning to introduce ideas and entities that will inform and populate his later Cthulhu Mythos tales, so these categories should not be considered as discrete or non-overlapping.&nbsp; Reprinted here are many of Lovecraft&#x2019;s most famous works, including &#x201c;The Call of Cthulhu&#x201d; (1928), &#x201c;The Dunwich Horror&#x201d; (1929), and &#x201c;The Shadow Over Innsmouth&#x201d; (1936), as well as a handful of lesser-known gems, including &#x201c;The Picture in the House&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Whisperer in the Darkness.&#x201d; These stories will introduce readers to Lovecraft&#x2019;s pantheon of &#x201c;gods,&#x201d; his characteristic themes, his fictitious New England geography and, of course, to the <i>Necronomicon</i>, Lovecraft&#x2019;s famous invented book of occult secrets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the absence of any real critical acclaim during his lifetime, H. P. Lovecraft has come to be recognized as, in Stephen King&#x2019;s estimation, &#x201c;the twentieth century&#x2019;s greatest practitioner of the classic horror tale,&#x201d; and the establishment of Lovecraft&#x2019;s literary reputation counts among the most remarkable literary tales of the twentieth century&#x2014;odder perhaps even than Lovecraft&#x2019;s characteristic tales of evolutionary degeneration, grotesque alien entities, and forbidden knowledge.&nbsp; Indeed, if one takes his admirers at their word, Lovecraft, a man whose literary output consisted of less than seventy tales and who never saw a book of his stories published in his lifetime, is Shakespeare and Elvis rolled into one!&nbsp; Horror writer Robert Bloch, author of <i>Psycho</i> and a member of the &#x201c;Lovecraft Circle&#x201d; of authors encouraged and influenced by Lovecraft, argues not only that Lovecraft&#x2019;s Cthulhu Mythos surpass in breadth and scope the worlds of both C. S. Lewis&#x2019;s <i>Narnia</i> series and J. R. R. Tolkein&#x2019;s Middle Earth series, but that Lovecraft may have had more influence on contemporary authors than anyone except Hemingway.[v]&nbsp; This is a remarkable claim about the work of a man who attracted little attention during his lifetime, whose ideas concerning race are hard to stomach today, and whose style has been described by those who are charitable as baroque and mocked by those who are not as florid and turgid.&nbsp; So what then is it about Lovecraft&#x2019;s work that has led these authors&#x2014;and other writers such as Clive Barker as well as film directors John Carpenter and Guillermo Del Toro and the artist H. R. Giger&#x2014;to acknowledge and celebrate its influence?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The answer has to do with Lovecraft&#x2019;s uneasy relationship with time.&nbsp; He was a man who simultaneously felt that he belonged to an earlier era, whose views (for better and worse) reflected those of his own time, and whose literary themes were ahead of their time in their anticipation of existentialism and post-modernism.&nbsp; Lovecraft as a product of the early twentieth century is most evident in his oft-remarked and notorious racism.&nbsp; He shared the commonly held view of the period that Anglo-Saxons occupied the pinnacle of the evolutionary ladder and non-Anglos were simply biologically and culturally inferior.&nbsp; Despite marrying a Jew, Lovecraft&#x2019;s anti-Semitism was frequently expressed in his correspondence, notably with Robert E. Howard, and Lovecraft&#x2019;s suspicions about &#x201c;foreigners&#x201d; and extreme aversion to the idea of miscegenation is everywhere evident in his literature&#x2014;from &#x201c;The Horror at Red Hook&#x201d; (1927), which Joshi characterizes as a &#x201c;a shriek of rage and loathing at &#x2018;foreigners&#x2019; who have taken New York away from the white people to whom it presumably belongs,&#x201d;[vi] to the mixed-race worshippers of Cthulhu, to the inbred fishmen of Innsmouth. Lovecraft everywhere associates non-European and mixed ethnicity with intellectual inferiority, physical deformity, and vice.&nbsp; Indeed, the French critic Michel Houellebecq makes the case that bigotry provides the motor force behind much of Lovecraft&#x2019;s greatest work.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And yet, unpalatable as Lovecraft&#x2019;s racial views are to most contemporary readers, what saves Lovecraft from simply parroting the myopic views of his times and attracts the modern gaze is that his racism is undercut&#x2014;at least in his fiction&#x2014;by his cosmicism, his philosophical position that, given the vastness of space and time, human civilization is wholly insignificant.&nbsp; Informing this cosmic view is Lovecraft&#x2019;s mechanical materialism, his belief that the universe operates according to fixed laws and that immaterial essences such as soul or spirit do not exist.&nbsp; This belief feeds readily into atheism, a topic on which Lovecraft made his views explicit:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All I say is that I think it is <i>damned unlikely</i> that anything like a central cosmic will, a spirit world, or an eternal survival of personality exist.&nbsp; They are the most preposterous and unjustified of all the guesses which can be made about the universe, and I am not enough of a hair-splitter to pretend that I don&#x2019;t regard them as arrant and negligible moonshine.&nbsp; In theory I am an <i>agnostic</i>, but pending the appearance of rational evidence I must be classed, practically and provisionally, as an <i>atheist</i>.[vii]&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lovecraft was ultimately a scientific rationalist&#x2014;a man who placed his faith in reason and science and who had little patience for religious dogma, superstition, and occultism.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What emerges from Lovecraft&#x2019;s cosmicism, and what is arguably his true achievement and the reason for his popularity today, is a body of literature that, as opposed to the Western humanistic tendency to stress the centrality of human beings to the cosmos, i...</p></p><h2>Tyranny in the Ashes</h2><p>Ben Raines and his army of patriots match wits with former USA leader Claire Osterman, a ruthless leader with a plan for revenge that could plunge the entire North American continent into a bloody civil war and that involves a dangerous alliance with a former Sandinista rebel out to seize control of Central America.

He lives in a medieval magical land that values tradition, and the annual gladiatorial Games are what he (and everyone else) looks forward to all year. When the Games finally do roll around, his partner gets sick and it seems like all hope is lost. Adrian wants to win the games to help out his mother, but he can't enter without a teammate. Out of nowhere, the rough and tumble fighter Richard Aldana appears, and Adrian is in the right place at the right time because the older man needs a partner, too. The unconventional duo proves successful, mainly because of Aldana's rough fighting style that completely eschews magic. This first installment in the graphic novel series, created by an all-star French trio, does a superb job of setting the stage for the epic battles to come. Adrian is a lovable protagonist, and Aldana is a mysterious fighter who will be a great mentor figure for the fatherless Adrian. Teens will be left on the edge of their seats rooting for the pair. The black-and-white illustrations are well done, engaging, and easy to follow. And while a few different story lines are introduced, they are not confusing.

It takes the form of a diary, recording the earliest days of World War II and the Nazi occupation of France, but this is no ordinary day book: it records the author's journey through a war-torn world without transcendence. Bataille's spiritual journey is also an intellectual one, a trip with Hegel, Kierkegaard, Blake, Baudelaire, and Nietzsche as his companions. And it is a school of the flesh wherein eroticism and mysticism are fused in a passionate search for pure immanence. Georges Bataille said of his work: "I teach the art of turning horror into delight." This new translation of Guilty is the first to include the full text from Bataille's Oeuvres Compl�tes. The text includes Bataille's notes and drafts, which permit the reader to trace the development of the book from diary to draft to published text, as well as annotations of Bataille's source materials. An extensive and incisive introductory essay by Stuart Kendall situates the work historically, biographically, and philosophically. Guilty is Bataille's most demanding, intricate, and multilayered work, but it is also his most personal and moving one.<strong>Georges Bataille (1897&#x2013;1962)</strong>, a medievalist librarian by training, founded the College of Sociology and the secret society Ac�phale.

Cain, was a key innovator in the development of the noir genre of crime fiction in the 1930s and 1940s. I Married a Dead Man is considered a classic of this uniquely American genre. I am fairly new to Cornell Woolrich as I have only previously read one of his novels, the suspenseful The Bride Wore Black. Woolrich wrote a large number of suspense novels, apparently of uneven quality. His best stories are very good and include The Phantom Lady, I Married A Dead Man, and his &#39;Black&#39; series (so-named from their titles). The plot for I Married a Dead Man twists and turns in an unpredictable manner. The layered, complex ending is quite good. I was completely unfamiliar with the plot and was continually surprised. If you are new to this book, avoid reading the summary on the dust jacket or elsewhere. Ignorance may not be bliss, but too much knowledge may spoil some of the surprise. But it won&#39;t hurt to think about the seemingly incongruous title. In my limited experience Cornell Woolrich selects his titles carefully. In retrospect, a simple title may suddenly have multiple meanings. I Married a Dead Man may be best compared to an Alfred Hitchcock movie. And, as matter of interest, Woolrich was the author of Rear Window.

Yet perhaps the most compelling gangster tale is one that has been, until now, too well-hidden. This is the story of the Outfit: the secretive organized crime cartel that began its reign in prohibition-era Chicago before becoming the real puppet master of Hollywood, Las Vegas, and Washington D.C. </p><p><i>The Outfit</i> recounts the adventures and exploits of its bosses, Tony 'Joe Batters' Accardo (the real Godfather), Murray 'The Camel' or 'Curly' Humphreys (one of the greatest political fixers and union organizers this country has ever known), Paul 'The Waiter' Ricca, and Johnny Rosselli (the liaison between the shadowy world and the outside world). Their invisibility was their strength, and what kept their leader from ever spending a single night in jail. The Outfit bosses were the epitome of style and grace, moving effortlessly among national political figures and Hollywood studio heads-until their world started to crumble in the 1970s. </p><p>With extensive research including recently released FBI files, the Chicago Crime files of entertainer Steve Allen, first-ever access to the voluminous working papers of the Kefauver Committee, original interviews with the members of the Fourth Estate who pursued the Outfit for forty years, and exclusive access to the journals of Humphrey's widow, veteran journalist Gus Russo uncovers sixty years of corruption and influence, and examines the shadow history of the United States.</p></p><p><p><b>Gus Russo</b> is the author of <i>Live By the Sword: The Secret War Against Castro and the Death of JFK</i>. He is an investigative reporter who has worked for various major television networks, including PBS' <i>Frontline</i> series.</p>Investigative reporter Russo (Live by the Sword: The Secret War Against Castro and the Death of JFK) offers an impressive in-depth history of Chicago's elusive crime syndicate. Unlike their trigger-happy East Coast counterparts, Chicago's gangsters stressed businesslike discretion following the chaotic Capone era, and they had a wide-ranging impact on American culture, entertainment and politics that has never been fully documented. Russo has new sources, ranging from entertainer Steve Allen's "crime files" to the widow of the book's most memorable figure, the Outfit's financial manager, "Curly" Humphreys. Others, like Paul "The Waiter" Ricca, will be known to Mob aficionados, but even they will note Russo's novel thesis, that the lucrative scams carried out during the group's 40-year heyday involved members of the respected "upperworld." These ventures ranged from the well known, such as the gambling operations that fueled Chicago's civic corruption, to the surprising (Mob-linked dairies were the first to use "sell by" dates). The Outfit started off-track betting and Top 40 charts and, in its declining years, the Outfit's "fixer," Sidney Korshak, vetted the cast of The Godfather. According to Russo, their "respectable" partners who publicly abhorred the gangster element included Joe Kennedy, MCA president Jules Stein, Bing Crosby, Presidents Roosevelt and Truman, and innumerable public servants. Russo humanizes the shadowy gangsters without denying their violent proclivities. He also examines them in the context of traditional immigrant ambitions. Russo's illuminating history may disorient some readers; still, this is the book to beat in examining this midcentury criminal empire.

Here's why: Thurman has a knack for helping laymen understand the teachings and history of Buddhism while also explaining why it has taken root in the West. Thurman was the first Westerner to be ordained as a monk in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition after studying under the Dalai Lama in 1964. In this highly polished memoir he tells the story of his pupilage under His Holiness, which was a frolic in Sunday school compared to the task of integrating Buddhism into cold war America.

But he also revealed himself to an extent that he never would in his later fiction. For if A Happy Death is the study of a rule-bound being shattering the fetters of his existence, it is also a remarkably candid portrait of its author as a young man. <br>As the novel follows the protagonist, Patrice Mersault, to his victim's house -- and then, fleeing, in a journey that takes him through stages of exile, hedonism, privation, and death -it gives us a glimpse into the imagination of one of the great writers of the twentieth century. For here is the young Camus himself, in love with the sea and sun, enraptured by women yet disdainful of romantic love, and already formulating the philosophy of action and moral responsibility that would make him central to the thought of our time. <br>Translated from the French by Richard HowardBorn in Algeria in 1913, <b>Albert Camus</b> published <i>The Stranger</i>&#x2014;now one of the most widely read novels of this century&#x2014;in 1942.

Although Evan dove off the government&#x2019;s radar years ago, he still practices the tradecraft that made him a top graduate of the Orphan Program--maintaining multiple safe houses, rerouting his electronic signals around the globe, avoiding emotional entanglements, and living his life by the Commandments his mentor/trainer Jack instilled in him to keep him alive. Evan also still practices his wetwork skills during rare vigilante acts to help those who are mercilessly preyed upon. When Evan is contacted by a woman in trouble with the Vegas mob, his attempts to help her literally put him in the line of fire. But are the bad guys after her--or is Evan the true target? As the plot goes deliciously serpentine, author Gregg Hurwitz peels back the layers of Evan&#x2019;s psyche, developing a character with the potential to be the next Jason Bourne or Jack Reacher.

Confronted with a hostile colonial government and Native Americans wary of conversion, the newly-appointed bishop-elect of Mexico wrote to tell the King of Spain that, unless there was a miracle, the continent would be lost. Between December 9 and December 12, 1531, that miracle happened, and it forever changed the future of the continent.<br><br>It was then that the Virgin Mary famously appeared to a Native American Christian convert on a hilltop outside of what is now Mexico City. The image she left imprinted on his cloak or tilma has puzzled scientists for centuries, and yet Our Lady of Gudalupe&#x2019;s place in history is profound. A continent that just months before the apparitions seemed completely lost to Christianity suddenly and inexplicably embraced it by the millions. Our Lady of Guadalupe's message of love replaced the institutionalized violence of the Aztec culture, and built a bridge between two worlds &#x2014; the old and the new &#x2014; that were just ten years earlier engaged in brutal warfare.<br><br>Today, Our Lady of Guadalupe continues to inspire the devotion of millions.<br>From Canada to Argentina &#x2014; and even beyond the Americas &#x2014; one finds great devotion to her, and great appreciation for her message of love, unity and hope. Today reproductions of the Virgin&#x2019;s miraculous image can be seen throughout North and South America, in churches and homes, on billboards and even clothing apparel. Her shrine in Mexico City, where the miraculous image is housed to this day, is one of the most visited in the world.<br><br>In <i>Our Lady of Guadalupe: Mother of the Civilization of Love,</i> Anderson &amp; Chavez trace the history of Our Lady of Guadalupe from the sixteenth century to the present discuss of how her message was and continues to be an important catalyst for religious and cultural transformation. Looking at Our Lady of Guadalupe as a model of the Church and Juan Diego as a model for all Christians who seek to answer Christ's call of conversion and witness, the authors explore the changing face of the Catholic Church in North, Central, and South America, and they show how Our Lady of Guadalupe's message was not only historically significant, but how it speaks to contemporary issues confronting the American continents and people today.</p><p>CARL ANDERSON, New York Times bestselling author, is the chief executive officer and chairman of the board of the Knights of Columbus.

We were both present that day in the basilica, but we had not yet met. One of us was par�ticipating in the liturgical event that he had worked to achieve for more than a decade as postulator of the Cause for Canonization of Juan Diego. The other had traveled to the basilica eighteen months earlier for his installation Mass as the head of the world&#x2019;s largest organization of Catholic laymen, the Knights of Columbus. Both of us were deeply touched by our experience that day in Mexico City, and both of us realized we had witnessed one of the most profound events in the Catholic Church during John Paul II&#x2019;s pontificate and indeed during our own lifetimes, an event that would give deep and lasting hope to the Catholic Church in North America. <br><br>This may strike many as an extraordinary claim; after all, John Paul II is now regarded universally as one of the greatest popes in the two�thousand�year history of the Catholic Church. As pope, he canonized and beatified hundreds of people, wrote numerous encyclicals on theological, moral, and social topics, and commis�sioned the <i>Catechism of the Catholic Church</i>, the first definitive work of its kind in more than four hundred years. He brought interreli�gious dialogue to new and unexpected levels while guiding the Church into the new millennium with the focus of hope in Christ. <br><br>Beyond the Church, he changed the political map of Europe and the very course of history by helping to liberate nations trapped behind the Iron Curtain during the Cold War and aiding in their cause for self�determination within the Soviet Union. Beyond Europe&#x2019;s bor�ders, his concerns for the poor, the disadvantaged, and the war�torn brought a greater commitment to human rights and democracy, especially to Latin America and Africa. But in Mexico that day, as he knelt and prayed awhile before the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe after the ceremony, it was clear that he did not want to leave; when he rose to leave, he entrusted all people to the interces�sion of the newest saint in the Church. He had not only canonized a man of the past but also given our continent a saint for the future. <br><br>Yet, early in John Paul&#x2019;s pontificate, Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico was an important, perhaps even indispensable, presence. In an interesting way, John Paul II&#x2019;s first invitation to the basilica was not intended for him; the Latin American Bishops Conference had extended the invitation to his predecessor the month before, and it was only his predecessor&#x2019;s death that opened this opportu�nity to John Paul II.1 In a telling way, it was John Paul II&#x2019;s deter�mined desire to pray at the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe and to personally engage in the meetings regarding the future of the Church in America that caused him to accept the invitation his predecessor had declined. (Twenty�three years later, Mexico would see this same determination; shortly before his trip for Juan Diego&#x2019;s canonization, John Paul II met with his medical special�ists, who advised against his making the trip. But at the end of the consultation, John Paul II thanked them for their concern and concluded the meeting by saying: &#x201c;I will see you in Mexico.&#x201d;) Later, John Paul II would reflect on his first visit to Mexico, recall�ing that &#x201c;to some degree, this pilgrimage inspired and shaped all of the succeeding years of my pontificate.&#x201d;2 <br><br>If John Paul&#x2019;s pilgrimage to Mexico shaped the rest of his life as the universal pastor of the Church, his choice to visit Mexico first and his words commending Juan Diego as an evangelist expressed a new importance and new understanding of the Church in the Americas.3 He recognized the Americas as a hemisphere with a unique, rich Catholic history, and thus as a hemisphere with a unique, rich place in the future of the Church, a hemisphere with great ability to respond to and benefit from a renewed living out of the Gospel of love seen in the witness of the saints. It was in this context that a few months later, the cause for Juan Diego&#x2019;s canonization was officially opened and the Church in the Americas was reexamined and given a new focus: the new evangelization. <br><br>NEW SAINT, RENEWED DEVOTION <br><br>The story of St. Juan Diego is, of course, the story of Our Lady of Guadalupe. The event of his canonization cannot be understood apart from the events of her appearance. As with any apparition claim, every detail of the Guadalupan accounts must be examined: each word spoken, each miraculous or extraordinary event that deviates from the everyday, the sequence of events, the character of the people involved, their reactions to the event, their lives afterward, and espe�cially any lingering miraculous effect. For this, we begin with Antonio Valeriano&#x2019;s Nica<i>n </i>Mopohua, an account of the Guadalupan apparitions in 1531, the earliest extant edition of which is currently housed in the New York Public Library.4 The historical record sug�gests that Valeriano may have derived the information in the Nica<i>n </i>Mopohu<i>a </i>directly from Juan Diego himself, writing it down some�time before Juan Diego&#x2019;s death in 1548 and within two decades of the apparition. Besides this significant work, numerous historical records recall in varying degrees of detail the Guadalupan appari�tions, the miraculous image, the church on Tepeyac hill, and Juan Diego&#x2019;s own life; some of the most substantial works include the Nica<i>n </i>Motecpana, the Informaci�<i>n </i>d<i>e </i>1556<i>, </i>and the Informacione<i>s </i>Jur�dica<i>s </i>d<i>e </i>1666. Other items composing the complex record of the Guadalupan event include written accounts, artwork, recorded oral testimonies, investigations, wills, and other works. <br><br>Because Juan Diego would be the first Mexican indigenous saint of that time and place, the canonization process demanded extensive research, requiring a grasp of both the history of colo�nization in New Spain and pre�Colonial culture and religion. Contemporary scholars, historians, and anthropologists specializ�ing in the culture and history of Mexico&#x2019;s Indian people were con�sulted, and nearly four thousand documents related to Our Lady of Guadalupe were reviewed. Ultimately, the knowledge and insights from such research have revealed the profound relevance and symbolic richness of the apparitions and the miraculous image on Juan Diego&#x2019;s <i>tilma </i>(a cloak�like garment), showing how the Guadalupan event conveys in the language and culture of the Indians a message of hope and love. <br><br>While the facts regarding Colonial Mexico cannot be changed, the perspective advocated by historians and even the public at large has changed. Unlike many scholars of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, contemporary biographers and histori�ans often highlight the Spanish conquest and occupation of Mexico as a volatile period of spiritual repression, conflict, and violence. By bringing to light the complexity of this period, con�temporary research has played an enormous role in helping us to better comprehend&#x2014;and even test the veracity of&#x2014;the Guadalupan apparitions. But unfortunately, while the idea of &#x201c;conversion by the sword&#x201d; is now familiar, some people may view the Guadalupan apparition and devotions as a mere by�product of colonization: as a strategic devotion fabricated by missionaries seeking to convert or pacify the Indians with a Christian�Aztec story, or as a subversive devotion adopted by Indians who were confused or sought to preserve elements of Aztec religion with a fa�ade of Christianity. <br><br>Undoubtedly, the Guadalupan devotions were a cause of concern and confusion at some times, but for us this should not be surprising, considering how even today, in the Information Age, we often encounter mixed reports even on less extraordinary events. While in this book we wish to do more than judge and debate about the Catholicity of Guadalupan devotees, nevertheless it is perhaps necessary to address some generalizations about the devotion that often sidetrack readers from the religious significance of the apparition&#x2019;s expression of the Gospel. <br><br>First, to write off the rise of Guadalupan devotion to manipu�lation and misunderstanding is not only simplistic but also histor�ically incongruous regarding a politically and religiously complex situation. Among the missionaries, there was no unified front encouraging the apparitions, as many missionaries doubted and even tried to suppress the Indians&#x2019; new devotion to the Guadalupan Virgin.5 Furthermore, while the missionaries desired conversions, their distrust of the Indians&#x2019; Catholicity verged on the scrupulous, even by modern standards; these same missionar�ies, some of whom were sophisticated letrado<i>s </i>(theologians) in Spain, were known to hold off giving Indians the sacraments and to eliminate symbolic elements of sacraments that were too simi�lar to Aztec rites solely in order to keep the distinctiveness of the Christian faith obvious.6 That is, although oversight may have occurred, purposeful theological contamination, deception, and obfuscation were largely out of character. Additionally, there was a whole range of converts among the Indians, including many who completely forsook their indigenous religious practices&#x2014;but not culture&#x2014;for a Christian way of life. What is more, their life as Christians went beyond practices or rites of belonging, such as baptism, to include catechesis. <br><br>Likewise, the rise of Guadalupan devotion cannot be explained as a devotion taken up to appease Christianizing government authorities; after all, at the time of the apparition, many of the Spanish authorities in Mexico were themselves incurring excom�munication, caring less for Christian life and evangelization than for their greed�ridden pursuit of political gains.7 The fact is, while the <i>people </i>in Mexico were involved in both political and religious changes, the <i>Guadalupan devotion </i>was not used politically until the devotion arrived in Spain, when an admiral in the royal Spanish fleet took up the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe in the battle of Lepanto and attributed the subsequent victory to her intercession. Moreover, even though in later Mexican history the image and devotion were appropriated to serve various political and econom�ic causes (notably during the 1810 War of Independence), the original meaning and message of Our Lady of Guadalupe tran�scends the flaws and purposes of those who have turned to her. <br><br>For some, Juan Diego may seem yet another individual &#x201c;divinized&#x201d; in answer to the universal human desire for heroes to look up to. This, too, reflects another trend of demythologizing the very men once lauded as great heroes. In this light, what is striking is how Juan Diego&#x2019;s role in the apparition&#x2014;even as passed down in testimonies&#x2014;is already rather humble. While he was called to a significant and meaningful task, he was not called to a &#x201c;great&#x201d; task by any measure of earthly grandeur. His role in the apparition itself&#x2014;his first and greatest claim to renown&#x2014;was not a call to conquer lands but a simple invitation to intercede on behalf of one person by communicating a request to another. In essence, it was to vouch for and trust in another person. This sim�ple act is the kernel of meaning and truth that is served, and not obscured, by the grandeur of the divine visitations, the healings, and the miraculous tilma. It was by answering this simple invita�tion that Juan Diego set himself apart; his was a gesture of humil�ity, communication, advocacy, and trust, a gesture that we perform in less miraculous ways and situations every day of our lives. It is one of the most fundamental gestures of our humanity and the foundation of any society that wishes to live beyond selfish utili�tarianism. <br><br>THE NEWNESS OF GUADALUPE <br><br>Consequently, although we believe the appearance of Our Lady of Guadalupe to be a historical fact, we do not think that it should be consigned only to the pages of history books. In fact, in a unique way, the full radicalness of Our Lady of Guadalupe&#x2019;s apparition can only be understood fully now, when Catholicism&#x2019;s most expressed model for society is a Civilization of Love and its greatest explication of human dignity is the Theology of the Body. For at the time, the violence institutionalized in Aztec religion was not the only place where harsh practices could be found: the European justice system employed in Colonial Mexico and many of the &#x201c;standards&#x201d; of holiness among Catholics often included severe punishments and harsh penitential practices that still make us uneasy, even if the practices were less violent and more theolog�ically different from the Aztec human sacrifices. What is notable is that this harshness is not corroborated in the words of the Virgin. In fact, while other Marian apparitions (such as those at Fatima and Lourdes) included words of admonishment or even warnings, Our Lady of Guadalupe&#x2019;s only words of spiritual guid�ance are her gentle but persistent reminders to Juan Diego about love: a love that can be trusted, a love that gives dignity, a love that is personal. If we are to see in her words an answer to a spiri�tual problem, the spiritual problem it answers is a lack of love and a lack of understanding about love as relationship rather than as practice. The Guadalupan message is, in its originality, a spiritual education, an education in love. <br><br>Today, as life is often characterized by a lack of love and by misunderstandings and misgivings about love, her message is one to take to heart. For this reason, like John Paul II, we think that one of the greatest influences of Our Lady of Guadalupe upon the history of the Western Hemisphere may still be before us. In the sixteenth century, Our Lady of Guadalupe became an expression of hope and unity for millions throughout the Americas. We are con�vinced that Our Lady of Guadalupe&#x2019;s message is <i>today </i>capable of being not only an expression but a true catalyst of hope and unity for millions more throughout North America and the world. <br><br>In the Christian sense, this hope and unity are spread through evangelization&#x2014;that is, through helping one another to find in Jesus Christ the &#x201c;adequate dimension&#x201d; of our own life.8 A clear picture of how Christians in this hemisphere can approach this task spiritually can be seen in the triptych that Benedict XVI pre�sented in Aparecida, Brazil, on his first apostolic journey to the Western Hemisphere, depicting St. Juan Diego &#x201c;evangelizing with the Image of the Virgin Mary on his mantle and with the Bible in his hand&#x201d; and inscribed below with the phrase &#x201c;You shall be my witnesses.&#x201d;9 To evangelize in the future is to evangelize from and through these first witnesses of Christianity. <br><br>Historically in our continent, Mexico was not the only coun�try to be changed by this Marian evangelization. As later mission�aries left Mexico for the neighboring countries in the hemisphere, including to the lands of the future United States, their evange�lization was defined by their devotion to Our Lady of Guadalupe.

It includes Thumbelina, a little girl no more than a thumb-joint high, \&#34;The Emperor&#39;s New Clothes\&#34;, the tale of a man who cares only for his appearance and The Little Mermaid, who longs to one day marry a human prince.</p><p>Hans Christian Andersen (1805-75) was born in Odense, Denmark, the son of a poor shoemaker and a washerwoman. As a young teenager, he became quite well known in Odense as a reciter of drama, and as a singer. When he was fourteen, he set off for the capital, Copenhagen, determined to become a national success on the stage. He failed miserably, but made some influential friends in the capital, who got him into school to remedy his lack of proper education. He hated school: aged seventeen, he was in a class of twelve-year-olds and was constantly mocked by them and by the teachers. In 1829 his first book - an account of a walking trip - was published. After that, books came out at regular intervals. At first, he considered his adult books more important than his fantasies. In later life, however, he began to see that these apparently trivial stories could vividly portray constant features of human life and character, in a charming manner. There were two consequences of this. First, he stopped regarding his stories as trifles written solely for children; second, he began to write more original stories, rather than retelling traditional tales. He once said that ideas for stories &#39;lie in my mind like seeds and only need the kiss of a sunbeam or a drop of malice to flower&#39;. He would often thinly disguise people he liked or disliked as characters in his stories: a woman who failed to return his love becomes the foolish prince in &#39;The Little Mermaid&#39;; his own ugliness and humiliation, or his father&#39;s daydream of being descended from a rich and powerful family, are reflected in &#39;The Ugly Duckling&#39;. Hans Andersen&#39;s stories began to be translated into English as early as 1846. Since then, numerous editions, and more recently Hollywood songs and a Disney cartoon, have helped to ensure the continuing popularity of the stories in the English-speaking world.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Danish</p><h2>The Moroccan Girl: A Novel</h2><p><p><b>&#x201c;Charles Cumming has breathed new life into the spy novel.&#x201d; &#x2015;Ben Macintyre, bestselling author of <i>A Spy Among Friends</i> </b><br><b> </b><br><b></b><b>Published in the UK as <i>The Man Between</i></b> <br> <b></b><br><b>In this gripping contemporary thriller, reminiscent of the classic <i>Casablanca</i>, a successful spy novelist is drawn into a real-life espionage plot when he&#x2019;s ordered to find a mysterious fugitive on the alluring but deadly streets of Morocco.</b></p><p>Renowned author Kit Carradine is approached by an MI6 officer with a seemingly straightforward assignment: to track down a mysterious woman hiding somewhere in the exotic, perilous city of Marrakesh.

Complex input was suspended, output temporarily unnecessary.</p><p>But a brain habituated to adrenaline could stand tranquility only so long before worry tunneled its way back.</p><p><i>What&#x2019;s Jase want?</i>&#x2014;followed closely by&#x2014;<i>We&#x2019;re not that far from moving</i>&#x2014;and:</p><p><i>This could be the big move. Natural, wouldn&#x2019;t it be, if that&#x2019;s what the navigators are doing up there, setting up the final move, that Jase would want to talk now?</i></p><p><i>It&#x2019;s my night. He knew he&#x2019;d wake me up. Jase could come here.</i></p><p><i>Couldn&#x2019;t be any ship-problem, could it? Nothing mechanical. Mechanical problems surely couldn&#x2019;t be at issue.</i></p><p>That was it. Now he&#x2019;d done it. He&#x2019;d thought about the ship itself&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;about the frail bubble of metal and ceramics around his cabin, beyond the shower, beyond the diplomatic enclave of passengers on five-deck.</p><p>Said ship had already endured, be it centuries ago, one spectacular and notorious navigational failure, stranding the original colonial mission in the great uncharted nowhere of the universe&#x2014;after which everything else had happened: escaping a nearly lethal star, reaching an inhabited planet. The survivors had built Alpha Station, in orbit about that planet&#x2014;and developed a bitter rift between those who wanted to stay in space and serve the ship, and those who wanted to go down to the green planet, take their fortunes and their lives in their hands and cast their lot with the steam-age locals.</p><p>A whole <i>world</i> of things had happened after that. The Alpha colonists, taking that dive into atmosphere, forever changed themselves, their culture <i>and</i> the native people in a direction no one had predicted.</p><p>Meanwhile that faction of humans who&#x2019;d stayed in space had taken the ship and gone searching for their misplaced homeworld. But the fervor for that mission had come aground a second time. They&#x2019;d ended up building another station in a fuel-rich system. Reunion was its name. And things had gone not so badly for them&#x2014;until a hundred-odd years into that station&#x2019;s existence, an unknown species had taken exception to their poking into other solar neighborhoods and attacked Reunion to make the point.</p><p>So the ship had come running frantically back to Alpha looking for fuel and help.</p><p>Which was at least the beginning of reasons why this ship now, with a sizeable delegation of concerned parties from the former Alpha colony and the indigenous government, was headed back out to that remote station&#x2014;ten years late, because things at Alpha hadn&#x2019;t been quite in order to jump to the ship&#x2019;s commands. The captain who&#x2019;d ordered the mission was dead, Alpha Station was in the hands of the atevi, the native, once steam-age species, who&#x2019;d taken command of their own destiny&#x2014;and the aiji, the atevi ruler, had sent his grandmother and his heir, among others, to see for themselves what sort of mess the ship-folk had made of their affairs at Reunion.</p><p>That was the quick version of ship history: a breakdown, a stranding, and local wars wherever they went. Given the ship&#x2019;s run of luck at important moments, and given a &#x201c;see-me-in-my-office&#x201d; from a friend who also happened to be one of the ship&#x2019;s two captains, well, yes, a dedicated planet-dweller, descendant of the Alpha colonists, could feel just a little bit of anxiety about this after-midnight summons.</p><p>Maybe he shouldn&#x2019;t have stopped to shower. Maybe he should have pulled on a pair of pants and a sweater and gotten straight up there.</p><p>But there&#x2019;d been a sense of &#x201c;when-you-can&#x201d; when he&#x2019;d gotten the summons. It was Jase&#x2019;s watch, so anything Jase wanted to say really was logically said in the middle of the night, granted the breakfast hour would have been far more convenient. &#x201c;Time to dress?&#x201d; he&#x2019;d asked. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Jase had said. So he&#x2019;d blundered into the shower half-asleep.</p><p>And the black-skinned, pastel-clad figures that moved calmly about duties outside the steamed-over shower glass&#x2014;they were fresh from their beds, too, his atevi staff, his protectors, getting his clothes ready. Hence the shower&#x2014;a blast of warm water to elevate his fallen body temperature and call said brain online.</p><p>He toggled off <i>recycle.</i> The shower circulation, formerly parked on endless loop, sucked up the damp from the air until what blew past was dry and warm as any desert. It stopped, preset, while his past-the-shoulder hair, that dignity of an atevi lord, still retained a residual, workable damp.</p><p>His servants would have heard the shower enter final cycle. He stepped out into comparatively cold air, and immediately Bindanda&#x2014;to whose stature he was about the size of a ten-year-old&#x2014;flung an appropriately child-sized robe about him. Bindanda, broad as well as tall, black-skinned, golden-eyed&#x2014;atevi, in short, and a somewhat plump fellow, very fond of food&#x2014;lapped the belt about him with hands that could break human arms and tied it with a delicacy that required no adjustment.</p><p>Perfect. The dressing-bench awaited. Bren sat down and let Asicho, the sole female among the servant staff, comb and braid his hair in its requisite pigtail.</p><p>Lord of the province of the heavens, Tabini-aiji had named him, sending him up from the planet to manage the space program&#x2014;oh so casually claiming in that action all the power that a newly named lord of the heavens could possibly lay at the aiji&#x2019;s feet, a small fact which Bren wasn&#x2019;t sure any of the ship&#x2019;s captains had ever quite grasped. It had taken <i>him</i> a little time to figure it&#x2014;and he&#x2019;d been Tabini&#x2019;s chief translator.</p><p>But it was perfectly reasonable, in the atevi view of things, to believe that where the aiji&#x2019;s representative went, so went the aiji&#x2019;s sphere of influence. Therefore sending the lord of the heavens to the limits of explored space expanded the aiji&#x2019;s claim of power, absent some strongly dissenting power in his path. There was a space station. So of <i>course</i> there was now a province of the heavens. Had not the aiji sent him there and appointed a lord to rule it? Second point&#x2014;had anyone contested that appointment? Had anyone else attempted to exert authority over the station? The Mospheirans, that island nation of former human colonists, couldn&#x2019;t make up their minds without a committee decision and the ship-folk certainly weren&#x2019;t interested in administering an orbiting province. The ship-folk as well as the Mospheirans had actually seemed glad to have some competent individual, atevi or human, handle it and see that the vending machines stayed full and the air stayed pure.</p><p>So that claim stuck. There <i>was</i> a province of the heavens.</p><p>And now that the ship-folk took their starship back to Reunion to deal with matters the ship had left unfinished&#x2014;dangerous ones at that&#x2014;the aiji in Shejidan sent out his emissaries to deal with deep space. Tabini-aiji sent his own grandmother, the aiji-dowager, and he sent his heir&#x2014;a minor child&#x2014;both constituting representation of the aiji&#x2019;s house itself, to show the flag, so to speak&#x2014;but to make that claim of a more permanent nature, he sent out his lord of the heavens to claim whatever territory seemed available. A man who&#x2019;d originally hoped to add a few words to the atevi-human lexicon as the sole monument to his life, Bren Cameron had certainly gotten farther than he intended.</p><p>By various small steps accelerating to a headlong downhill rush, his life hadn&#x2019;t gone as planned. Bren found himself here, wherever here was. He found himself assigned to assert a claim the aiji-dowager would&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;well, <i>witness</i> or <i>bless</i> or otherwise legitimize&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;establishing an atevi claim to presence in the universe at large. Most pointedly, he would assert the atevi right to have a major say in the diplomatic outcome of whatever they met, and the dowager would look it all over and nod politely. And he wasn&#x2019;t sure the ship-folk, except Jase, remotely understood what he was doing here.</p><p>Maybe, Bren said to himself, he ought to be honest about his mission&#x2014;not go on wearing the white ribbon of the neutral paidhiin, the translators. Maybe he should adopt a plain one, black, for a province of empty space&#x2014;</p><p>Black, for the Assassins who watched over him. Black, for the lawyers of atevi society, the mediators of last resort. White of the paidhiin was, well, what he hoped to go on doing: translate, mediate, straighten out messes. Lord&#x2019;s title and assignment to the heavens be damned, he planned to come home and ask for his old job back: more extravagantly, someday next year or so he hoped, at lordly leisure, to sit on his porch and watch the sea for three days straight.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;granted Jase wasn&#x2019;t calling him up there at the moment to give him advance warning that the ship had broken down and stranded the lot of them forever in deep space.</p><p>Asicho finished the ribbon-arranging. He stood up from the bench. Narani, his white-haired and grandfatherly head of staff, had already laid out the appropriate clothing on the bed, and Jeladi, the man of all work, assistant to everyone on staff, waited quietly to help him on with the starched, lace-cuffed shirt. The stockings and the trousers, he managed for himself. And the glove-leather, knee-high boots.</p><p>&#x201c;Nadi,&#x201d; he said then to Jeladi, inviting the assistance. Narani had pressed the lace to knife-edged perfection, and Jeladi moved carefully, so the all-grasping lace failed to snag his pigtail. Asicho, in turn, helped him on with his knee-length day-coat while Jeladi held the pigtail safely aside from its high collar, and Bindanda helped arrange the shirttail.</p><p>Not so much froth on the shirt sleeves as to make it necessary to put both coat and shirt on together&#x2014;but not quite a one-person operation, as styles had gotten to be. His increased rank had increased the amount of lace&#x2014;which had turned up in baggage: trust Narani. The lord of this household would go out the door, onto executive levels, as if he walked the halls of the Bu-javid in Shejidan.</p><p>The shirttail went in immaculately. The pigtail survived the collar. His two servants gently tugged the starched lace from under the cuffs, adjusted the prickly fichu, and pronounced him fit to face outsiders.</p><p>In no sense was a man of rank alone&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;not for a breath, not an instant. The servants, including Narani, including Bindanda, lined his doorway. The sort of subterranean signals that had permeated the traditional arrangements of his onworld apartments, that they had translated to the space station, had likewise established themselves very efficiently on the ship, in human-built rooms, rooms with a linear arrangement in&#x2014;that abomination to atevi sensibilities&#x2014;pairs. In their section of five-deck, in loose combination with the aiji-dowager&#x2019;s staff in the rooms considerably down the hall, the staff still managed to pass their signals and work their domestic miracles outside the ship&#x2019;s communications and outside his own understanding.</p><p>So it was no surprise to him at all that Banichi and Jago likewise turned up ready to go with him; his security, uniformed in black leather and silver metal, and carrying a fairly discreet array of electronics and armament for this peaceful occasion: a lord didn&#x2019;t leave his quarters without his bodyguards, not on earth, not on the station, and not here in the sealed steel world of the ship, and his bodyguards never gave up their weapons, not even at their lord&#x2019;s table or in his bedroom.</p><p>&#x201c;Asicho will take the security station,&#x201d; Jago said, pro forma. Jago and Banichi were now off that station. Of course Asicho would. In this place with only a handful of staff, they all did double and triple duty, and even Asicho managed, somehow, despite the language barrier, to know a great deal that went on in ship&#x2019;s business.</p><p>But not everything. Not middle-of-the-night summonses from the second captain.</p><p>Guards they passed in the corridor marked Ilisidi&#x2019;s residency&#x2014;her security office, her kitchen, her personal rooms. No more than polite acknowledgment from that quarter attended their passage: but that they were awake and about, the dowager&#x2019;s staff now knew. Ilisidi&#x2019;s security, perhaps Cenedi himself, given the unusual nature of this call, would be in constant touch with Asicho&#x2014;not the dowager&#x2019;s idle curiosity. It was Cenedi&#x2019;s job, at whatever hour.</p><p>Two more of Ilisidi&#x2019;s young men guarded the section door. Beyond that, at a three-way intersection of the curving corridors, on the Mospheirans&#x2019; collective doorstep (meaning Ginny Kroger and her aides and technicians, their robotics and refueling operations specialists) was the short alcove of the so-named personnel lift. They walked in and Banichi immediately pushed the requisite buttons.</p><p>The lift this time lifted fairly well straight up, where it stopped and opened its doors onto the bridge with a pressurized wheeze. They exited in that short transverse walkway at the aft end of the bridge. Beyond it, banks of consoles and near a hundred techs and seniors stayed at work by shifts&#x2014;half a hundred tightly arranged consoles, the real running of the ship. The walkway aimed at the short corridor on the far side of the bridge, where the executive offices, as well as the captains&#x2019; private cabins&#x2014;and Jase&#x2019;s security guards on duty in that corridor&#x2014;were found.</p><p>If those two were there, Jase was there. On Jase&#x2019;s watch, the senior captain, Sabin, was likely snug abed at the moment&#x2014;a favorable circumstance, s...</p></p><h2>Warcraft: War of the Ancients #2: The Demon Soul</h2><p><b>THE BURNING LEGION HAS COME.</b> <br><br> Led by the mighty Archimonde, scores of demonic soldiers now march across the lands of Kalimdor, leaving a trail of death and devastation in their wake. At the heart of the fiery invasion stands the mystic Well of Eternity -- once the source of the night elves' arcane power. But now the Well's energies have been defiled and twisted, for Queen Azshara and her Highborne will stop at nothing to commune with their newfound god: the fiery Lord of the Burning Legion...<i>Sargeras.</i> <br><br> The night elf defenders, led by the young druid, Malfurion Stormrage, and the wizard, Krasus, fight a desperate battle to hold back the Legion's terrible onslaught.

The dragons -- led by the powerful Aspect, <i>Neltharion</i> -- have forged a weapon of incalculable power: the Dragon Soul, an artifact capable of driving the Legion from the world forever. But its use may cost far more than any could have foreseen. <br><br> The second novel in an original trilogy of magic, warfare, and heroism based on the bestselling, award-winning electronic game series from Blizzard Entertainment.</p><p>Richard A.

In addition, his novels and short stories have been published worldwide in such diverse places as China, Iceland, the Czech Republic, and Brazil.&nbsp;<b>Chapter One</b><br><br>The voices whispered in his head as he moved through the huge cavern. Where once they were but an occasional occurrence, now they never ceased. Even in his sleep, he could not escape their presence...not that he wanted to do so anymore. The huge black dragon had heard them for so long that they were now a part of him, indistinguishable from his own twisted thoughts.<br><br><i>The night elves will destroy the world...<br><br>The Well is out of control...<br><br>No one can be trusted...they want your secrets, your power...<br><br>Malygos would take what is yours...<br><br>Alexstrasza seeks dominion over you...<br><br>They are no better than the demons...<br><br>They must be dealt with like the demons...</i><br><br>Over and over, the voices repeated such dire things, warning him of duplicity, betrayal. He could trust no one but himself. The others were tainted by the lesser races. They would see his decision as a danger, not the only hope for the world.<br><br>The dragon unleashed a puff of noxious smoke as he snorted at such treachery from those who had once been his comrades. Though he had the power to save everything, he had to be careful; if they discovered the truth too soon, it would mean calamity.<br><br><i>They must not know its secret until it is beyond their altering, he decided. It cannot be presented until the spell must be cast. I will not let them destroy my work!</i><br><br>Huge claws scraped fresh the rock floor of the cavern as the scaly behemoth entered his sanctum. As massive as the dragon was, the rounded cavern dwarfed him. A molten river flowed through the center. Massive crystal formations glittered in the walls. Huge stalactites hung like swords of doom from above, while stalagmites grew from the ground so sharp that they looked as if they waited for someone to be impaled upon them.<br><br>And, in fact, such was the case with one.<br><br>Teeth bared, the great black dragon peered down at the puny figure struggling to free himself despite the stony spike thrusting up through his heaving chest. The remains of a tattered, black and bloodred robe and fragments of ornate, golden armor hung around his oddly-shaped torso. High, goatlike horns thrust from his skull and the crimson visage resembled most to the dragon a long skull with a wide, fanged maw. The eyes were pits of darkness that immediately tried to suck the behemoth in, but they were no match for the will of the creature's captor.<br><br>In addition to being impaled, the horned figure was bound by thick, iron chains to the cavern floor. The chains had been set especially tight, pinning the demon to the stalagmite and keeping his limbs spread downward.<br><br>Constantly the captive's mouth moved as if he furiously shouted something, yet no sound emerged. That did not keep him from trying, however, especially when he saw the dark leviathan approach.<br><br>The dragon mulled over his prisoner for a moment, then blinked.<br><br>Immediately the cavern chamber filled with the venom-laced, rasping voice of the creature. " -- is Sargeras! Your blood will flow! Your skin he will wear for a cloak! Your flesh will feed his hounds! Your soul he will keep in a vial, ever to torment at his pleasure! He -- "<br><br>Blinking again, the dragon silenced once more his captive. Even still, the demonic figure continued mouthing threats and obscenities until, finally, the dark behemoth opened his huge jaws and exhaled, enveloping the prisoner in a searing plume of steam that left the latter shaking in renewed agony.<br><br>"You will learn respect. You are in the presence of my glorious self, I, Neltharion," the dragon rumbled. "I am the Earth Warder. You will treat me with the reverence which I deserve."<br><br>The demon's long, reptilian tail slapped at the rocks below. The mouth opened in what was obviously more silent blasphemies.<br><br>Neltharion shook his crested head. He had expected better from the Eredar. The warlocks were supposed to be among the commanders of the Burning Legion, demons not only skilled at casting spells but well-versed in battle tactics. The dragon had assumed that he would hear far more intelligent conversation from such a creature, but the Eredar might as well have been one of the brutish Infernals, the flaming, skull-headed behemoths who acted like fearsome battering rams or airborne missiles. The one he had tested before capturing the Eredar had only the wit of a rock, if even that much.<br><br>But then, Neltharion had not sent his flight out to pluck the demons from their rampaging horde for conversation. No, the captives had another purpose, a grand one that they, unfortunately, could never come to appreciate.<br><br>And the Eredar was the last, the most significant. His innate magical abilities made him the key to fulfilling the first part of the Earth Warder's quest.<br><br><i>It is time...</i>the voices whispered. <i>It is time...</i><br><br>"Yes..." Neltharion answered absently. "Time..."<br><br>The dragon raised one huge paw palm up and concentrated. Immediately a golden aura flared to life in his palm, growing so brilliant that even the captive demon paused in his tirades to stare at what Neltharion had summoned to him.<br><br>The tiny disk was as golden as the aura that had presaged its coming, but otherwise it was an astoundingly simple-looking piece. It would not have even quite filled the hand of a much smaller creature -- say a Night Elf, for instance. The disk resembled a large, featureless gold coin with rounded edges and a gleaming, untarnished shell. Its very unassuming appearance was all by Neltharion's design. If the talisman was to perform its task properly, it had to seem entirely innocent, harmless.<br><br>He held it toward the warlock, letting the Eredar see what awaited him. The demon, however, appeared quite unimpressed. He stared from the disk to the dragon, mockery filling his eyes.<br><br>Neltharion noted the reaction. It pleased him that the Eredar did not recognize the strength of the disk. That meant that others would also fail to realize the truth...until it was too late.<br><br>At the Earth Warder's silent command, the object rose gently from his palm. It floated above the paw for a moment, then drifted over to the captive.<br><br>For the first time, a hint of uncertainty colored the warlock's monstrous visage. As the disk descended, he renewed his futile struggles.<br><br>The golden talisman alighted on the demon's forehead. A brief flash of crimson light bathed the Eredar's face -- and then the disk sealed itself to his flesh.<br><br><i>Speak them...</i>urged the voices as one. <i>Say the words...seal the act...</i><br><br>From the savage, lipless maw of the dragon erupted words from a language whose origins lay not in the mortal world. Each one was tinged with an evil that made even the demon quiver. To the Earth Warder, though, they were the most wondrous sounds he had ever heard, perfect musical notes...the language of gods.<br><br>As Neltharion spoke them, the disk began to glow again. Its radiance filled the vast chamber, growing brighter and brighter with each syllable.<br><br>The light suddenly flared.<br><br>The Eredar warlock stretched his mouth as wide as it would go in a noiseless cry. His horrific eyes rained tears of blood and his tail slashed madly against the rocks. He tore at his bonds with such fervor that he scraped away the flesh from his wrists and ankles. But still the demon could not escape.<br><br>Then the Eredar's skin started to decay. It crumbled from his still-twisting body, his still-shrieking countenance. The demon's flesh became as if a thousand years dead, dropping from him in dry, ashy bits.<br><br>The eyes sank in. The tail shriveled. The warlock swiftly reduced to a cage of bone surrounding rapidly-putrefying entrails. Yet throughout the macabre ordeal, he continued to scream, for Neltharion and the disk had not so far permitted him the comfort of death.<br><br>But at last, even the bone gave way, collapsing inward and fragmenting. The jaw fell loose and the ribs rolled away with a clatter. With terrible efficiency, the power unleashed by the disk absorbed the demon's remains from the bottom up. The trail of dry dust spread fast from the feet to the legs to the torso until only the skull was left.<br><br>And only then did the Eredar grow still.<br><br>The sinister light ceased. The chains once holding the demon dangled empty.<br><br>Like a doting father reaching for a cherished offspring, the black dragon used two claws to gently lift the talisman from the skull. As Neltharion did this, the skull, too, turned to ash. The gray powder scattered over the ground.<br><br>He stared with admiration at what he had wrought. Neltharion could not even sense the extraordinary forces now residing in the disk, but he knew that they were there -- and when the time came, they would be his to command.<br><br>No sooner had he thought this than another presence touched his mind. The voices subsided abruptly, as if they feared discovery by this intruder. The Earth Warder himself immediately smothered his own desires.<br><br>Neltharion knew the touch well. Once he had believed it to come from a friend. Now the dark leviathan understood that he could trust her no more than he could the rest.<br><br><i>Neltharion...I must speak with you...<br><br>What is your wish, dear Alexstrasza?</i> The Earth Warder could imagine her. A sleek, fire-colored dragon even slightly more imposing than himself. As he was the physical Aspect of the world's innate strength, so was she the Aspect of the Life that flourished in, on, and above it.<br><br><i>There are dangerous forces again playing around the palace of the night elves' queen...we must come to some decision and soon...<br><br>Fear not,</i> Neltharion replied soothingly. <i>What must be done will be done...<br><br>I pray it will be so...how soon can you make the journey to the Chamber?</i><br><br>The Earth Warder imagined that other place in his mind, a mammoth cavern that made his own seem but the burrowing of a single worm. The Chamber of the Aspects, as the lesser dragons respectfully called it, was also perfectly round and smooth, as if at some point in the past -- before even the coming of the dragons -- someone had set some great sphere into motion, completely shaving away the ripples and outgrowths found normally in caves. Nozdormu, to whom all things involving history were fascinating, believed that the creators of the world had made it, but even he could not prove so with any certainty. Hidden by a field of magic that kept it from the mortal world, the Chamber was the most trusted and secure of places anywhere.<br><br>Thinking that, the black dragon hissed low in anticipation. His crimson gaze shifted to the disk. Perhaps he should go there now. The others would all be there. It could be done...<br><br><i>No...not yet,</i> said the voices just barely audible in the back of his subconscious. <i>The timing must be right or they will steal what is yours...</i><br><br>Neltharion could not let that happen, not when he was so near to triumph. <i>Not now,</i> he finally told the red dragon, <i>but soon...I promise it will be soon...<br><br>It must be,</i> Alexstrasza replied. <i>I fear it must be.</i><br><br>She left his thoughts as quickly as she had entered them. Neltharion hesitated, trying to determine whether or not he had left to her some hint of what was going on. The voices, however, assured him that he had not, that he had done very, very well.<br><br>The black dragon held high the disk, then, with a satisfied look in his blazing eyes, conjured it back to where he kept it hidden from all others, even his own blood.<br><br>"Soon..." he whispered as it vanished, a toothy grin stretching across his monstrous visage. "Very soon...after all, I <i>did</i> promise..."<br><br>The mighty palace stood on the edge of a mountainous precipice overlooking a vast, turbulent lake whose waters were so dark as to be utterly black. Trees augmented magically by solid rock created tall, spiral towers that jutted up like fearsome warriors. Walls made of volcanic stone that had been bound by monstrous vines and tree roots surrounded the huge edifice. A hundred gargantuan trees had been drawn together by the power of the builders to create the framework of the main building, then the rounded structure had been covered with stone and vine.<br><br>Once, to any who gazed upon it, the palace and its surroundings had been one of the wonders of the world...but that had changed, especially in recent times. Now the foremost tower stood shorn of its upper half. The blackened stone fragments and dangling bits of vine spoke of the intensity of the explosion that had destroyed it. That alone had not turned the palace into a place of nightmare, though. Rather, it was what now surrounded the once-proud edifice on all sides, save where the foreboding lake demanded dominion.<br><br>It had been a magnificent city, the culmination of night elf rule. Spread out over the landscape and very much a part of it, the high tree homes and sprawling habitations built into the earth itself had created a wondrous setting for the palace. Here had been built Zin-Azshari -- "The Glory of Azshara" in the old tongue, and the capital of the night elves' realm. Here had stood a teeming metropolis whose citizens had risen every eve to give homage to their beloved queen.<br><br>And here, save for a few select, walled regions flanking the palace, had been a slaughter of innocents such as the world had never seen.<br><br>Zin-Azshari lay in ruins, the blood of its victims still staining the broken and burnt shells of their homes. The towering tree homes had been ripped to the ground and those built into the earth had been plowed under. A thick, greenish mist drifted over the nightmarish landscape. The stench of death yet prevailed -- the corpses of hundreds of victims lay untouched and slowly rotting, a process made all the slower and more grotesque by the absolute absence of any carrion creatures. No crows, no rats, not even insects nibbled at the chopped and torn bodies, for they, too, had either fled with the few survivors or fallen to the onslaught that had claimed the city.<br><br>But although such carnage surrounded them, the remaining inhabitants of Zin-Azshari seemed not to notice it one bit. The tall, lanky night elves remaining in the city went about their tasks in and around the palace as if nothing had changed. With their dark, purple skin and extravagant, multicolored robes, they looked as if they attended some grand festival. Even the grim guards in forest-green armor standing watch at the parapets and walls appeared out of place, for they stared out at wholesale death without so much as batting an eye. Not one narrow, pointed visage reflected the slightest dismay.<br><br>Not one registered fear or horror at the grotesque giants moving in and among the debris in search of any possible survivor or spy.<br><br>Hundreds of armored, demonic warriors of the Burning Legion scoured Zin-Azshari while hundreds more marched out of the palace's high gates to supplement those moving beyond the capital. At their hand had this fair realm fallen and, given the chance, they would scour over the rest of the world, slaying all in their path.<br><br>Most were nine feet high and more, towering over even the seven-foot-tall night elves. A furious green flame perpetually surrounded each, but did not harm them. Their lower bodies were oddly thin, then expanded greatly at the chest. Their monstrous countenances resembled fanged skulls with huge horns atop and all had eyes of red blood that peered hungrily over the landscape. Most carried massive, pointed shields and glowing maces or swords. These were the Fel Guard, the bulk of the Legion.<br><br>Above them, with wings of fire, the Doomguard kept watch on the horizon. Similar otherwise to their brethren below...</p><h2>Sacred luxuries: fragrance, aromatherapy and cosmetics in ancient Egypt</h2><p>The art of modern fragrance-making owes much to practices developed in ancient Egypt. The Egyptians attached great importance to perfumes and cosmetics, which men and women wore to make themselves attractive and alluring, to restore vitality and good health, and as a means of venerating the gods and of negotiating a passage to the realm of the hereafter. In this lavishly illustrated, oversized book, Lise Manniche looks at the role played by scents and cosmetics in ancient Egyptian society and discusses their preparation&#x2015;in some cases providing actual recipes.Manniche details three categories of ingredients used by the Egyptians to make fragrances: plants, including cardamom, cinnamon, saffron, and mint; gums and resins, particularly myrrh and frankincense; and oils and fats ranging from almond oil to ox fat. "In order [for a scent] to achieve fame," Manniche writes, "the finished product had to have an aura of rarity, of exclusiveness, and of the divine. The more exotic the ingredients, the more valued the commodity; the more exquisite its presentation, the greater the appeal. In this way, the visual and olfactory arts combined to make small objects of the greatest luxury appreciated not only in Egypt, but all over the ancient world."Drawing on Arabic and other sources, Manniche explores the application of perfumes in ritual and on social occasions, and examines the erotic connotations of scent in Egyptian art and poetry. Fragrant remedies, the central element in ancient medicine, are fully discussed. Finally, she investigates the widespread use of cosmetics, as revealed in wall paintings and painted sculptures. The book features a hundred color photographs, taken by Werner Forman, of objects in the world's most celebrated museum collections. Exquisite cosmetic containers in the form of birds and animals, reliefs representing kings and priests perfuming images of deities, and lifelike mummy masks displaying make-up are among the images represented.During the past decade, the West has seen a revival of traditional skills, particularly in the areas of spirituality and healing. This stunning book introduces an abundance of once highly prized skills to be reacquired and ancient products to be sampled anew.</p><p>"Anyone interested in the art of fragrance will be captivated by this book. . . . Reading it, one can almost smell the ancient Egyptian perfume. It's all sweetness and delight. Manniche's genuine love for her subject is evident on every page. This book is a treat for the mind, the eye, and the nose."&#x2015;Marie-Paule Vanlathem, Scientific American. January/February, 2000.<br><br>"This publication introduces the ingredients used in ancient Egyptian perfumes and incense, the sources of and trade in these materials, and their social and religious significance to the Egyptians. It is beautifully illustrated with color images of ancient cosmetic utensils and scenes from Egyptian tombs and Islamic manuscripts."&#x2015;Denise M. Doxey, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Religious Studies Review, Vol. 27, No. 2, April 2001<br><br>"Perfume was so important a part of ancient Egyptian life that it is remarkable that there are no other monographs on the subject. Noted author Manniche studies the role of perfume and scent in Egyptian society as medicine, aphrodisiac, incense, and cosmetic. . . . Scholarly but readable."&#x2015;Library Journal. March 1, 2000.<br><br>"If you have ever been fascinated by the beauty of literally thousands of extant containers produced by the ancient Egyptians for holding cosmetics, unguents, oils, incense, etc., and wondered about the actual composition of all of these varied substances and their importance to the dwellers along the Nile in antiquity, this beautifully illustrated book is for you. Lise Manniche has done extensive research on the aforementioned substances and Sacred Luxuries is certain to stand as the definitive account of the subject for a long time to come."&#x2015;David Moyer, KMT. Spring, 2000.<br><br>"A lavishly illustrated 'must have' treasure trove of knowledge, enjoyment and inspiration."&#x2015;M. A. Murray-Pierce, Fragrance Forum. Winter/Spring 2000.<br><br>"Manniche gives us an excellent look at this fascinating yet unfamiliar aspect of Ancient Egyptian society. A lot of careful and hard work has gone into producing this beautiful book, which is recommended for those interested in fragrances, beauty care and, of course, Ancient Egypt."&#x2015;The Reviewer, June 2000Two unique new titles examine aspects of the culture of ancient Egypt. Paintings of people wearing incense cones on their wigs, sniffing flowers, and anointing just about anything; palettes for preparing cosmetics; and quantities of both romantic and religious literature all show the major role played by scent in Egyptian culture. Perfume was so important a part of ancient Egyptian life that it is remarkable that there are no other monographs on the subject. Noted author Manniche (Egyptology, Univ. of Copenhagen) studies the role of perfume and scent in Egyptian society as medicine, aphrodisiac, incense, and cosmetic. For the adventurous, Manniche even includes recipes from a variety of classical sources as well as Egyptian manuscripts. Recommended for large collections on the history of perfumes, aromatherapy, and folk medicine as well as general collections seeking scholarly but readable material on ancient Egyptian lifestyles. ~ Unlike other ancient civilizations, the Egyptians had large gold deposits within the boundaries of their lands. Esteemed late professor M?ller (Egyptology, Univ. of Munich) examines the place of gold in Egyptian life in all its aspects from mining to the creation of vessels and jewelry. Thiem's photographs are dramatic and sumptuous, exuding the sensuous quality of the artifacts; full- and double-page illustrations allow detailed examination of the workmanship for many items. Standard addenda such as a dynastic chronology are supplemented by an unusual but very helpful glossary of "Colored Stones and Their Sources" and a pictorial list of three dozen of the most common hieroglyphs. An excellent table of contents helps to make up for the regrettable lack of an index. Recommended for all libraries with an interest in Egyptian art history.<br><i>-Mary Morgan Smith, Northland P.L., Pittsburgh </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Woodcut Artist&#39;s Handbook: Techniques and Tools for Relief Printmaking</h2><p><p> <i>A clearly written and meticulously illustrated reference for woodcut techniques and printmaking.</i> </p><p> The history of the woodcut goes back over a thousand years. Working carefully with great precision, the woodcut artist carves a mirror image of a design on wood or other suitable material. Then the design is inked and pressed against paper. The technique allows the artist to create an almost unlimited number of impressions of the same work. The precision of the work and the ability of the artist to create multiple impressions allow many fine woodcut artists to create pieces at a reasonable price that an average collector can afford. </p><p> <b>The Woodcut Artist's Handbook</b> provides the basics of this craft with a detailed analysis of the tools and the media. Artists can improve or develop considerable skill in this art by following these instructions and helpful tips. Beginners and advanced woodcutters and collectors will gain a deeper understanding of and appreciation for this craft and this art. </p><p> This profusely illustrated book is ideal for artists, printmakers, designers and collectors. </p></p><p><p> <b>George A. Walker</b> is an award-winning wood engraver, book artist and illustrator who has been creating artwork and books at his private press since 1984. His courses in book arts and printmaking at the Ontario College of Art and Design are very popular. George exhibits his wood engravings and limited-edition books internationally. </p>Preface <p>My love of printmaking -- some would call it an obsession -- began with the discovery of the powerful graphic novels of Flemish artist and pacifist Frans Masereel. As I turned the pages of his books, I began to realize that I too could use this art form to communicate my own ideas. Because they don't depend on words, prints can be understood by anyone, anywhere, and all you need to make one is a graver, a piece of wood, ink, a roller, paper and a spoon. </p><p>Masereel's novels of the 1920S led me to the work done a decade later by Lynd Ward, who also portrayed the struggle for social justice and the search for meaning in an often cruel and unforgiving world. As I learned about the history of printmaking, I was struck by how often the wood-block print had been used over the years as a tool of social change and revolution. In my own small way, I joined that long tradition. </p><p>When I was nineteen, I lived in a rundown apartment building in the heart of Toronto. The roof leaked and every apartment was infested with cockroaches. One day the landlord disappeared, taking that month's rent money with him. The bank soon closed in, demanding that the tenants pay all the stolen rent money. We had no money for a lawyer, so I pulled out my ink, found a piece of wood and printed copies of a poster with a vulture on it. When the bank sent inspectors to examine the building and meet with the tenants, they found the halls and doors plastered with my prints. The posters brought the tenants together as a group and gave a voice to our anger and frustration. </p><p>In the end, we were able to keep our apartments without paying for our landlord's crime. </p><p>I continue to be inspired by the rich blacks, cut marks and impressed lines of wood-block prints. There isn't a single method of learning the secrets of this art. Mastering it requires a journey that each of us begins with our own unique experiences, bringing a personal style that makes our work distinctive. </p><p>The Woodcut Artist's Handbook will help you with the technical stuff and provide some tips and tricks to make the journey a pleasant one. The best training in technique is to look at the work of other artists. The generosity of those who have allowed their work to be displayed in these pages is truly appreciated. Unfortunately, some of the richness in the blacks and subtleties of hue that can be controlled in handprinted images are lost in the reproduction process. Nevertheless, the bold gesture of the line and the character and feeling of the original images remain. </p><p>As you enjoy the prints in this book and begin making them, I hope you will begin to understand my personal obsession with the wood-block print and, in time, develop an obsession of your own.</p></p><h2>Monsieur Linh and His Child</h2><p>Traumatized by memories of his war-ravaged country, and with his son and daughter-in-law dead, Monsieur Linh travels to a foreign land to bring the child in his arms to safety. The other refugees in the detention centre are unsure how to help the old man; his caseworkers are compassionate, but overworked. Monsieur Linh struggles beneath the weight of his sorrow, and becomes increasingly bewildered and isolated in this unfamiliar, fast-moving town. And then he encounters Monsieur Bark. They do not speak each other's language, but Monsieur Bark is sympathetic to the foreigner's need to care for the child.

"My mother works as a waitress in the Blue Tile Diner," the little-girl narrator begins -- and to the accompaniment of vividly colored, direct, proto-primitive pictures -- the real, life-like story comes out. At home is a glass jar, into which goes all Mama's change from tips and the money Grandma saves whenever she gets a bargain at the market. "When we can't get a single other coin into the jar, we are going to take out all the money and go and buy a chair ... A wonderful, beautiful, fat, soft armchair." This is because -- we see as she tells it -- all the family's furniture burned up in a fire; and though neighbors and friends and relatives brought replacements (a buttercup-and-spring-green spread to contrast with the charred gray gloom just preceding), "we still have no sofas and no big chairs." Only straight, hard, kitchen chairs. Then the jar is full; the coins are rolled in paper wrappers, and exchanged for bills; and "Mama and Grandma and I" go shopping for the chair. This last sequence is a glory: Grandma feeling like Goldilocks, trying out all the chairs; the very rose-covered chair "we were all dreaming of," plump in the middle of the floor; the little girl and her mother, snuggled in it together ... and she can reach right up "and turn out the light if I fall asleep in her lap." It's rare to find so much vitality, spontaneity, and depth of feeling in such a simple, young book.</p><h2>No Nukes: Everyone&#39;s Guide to Nuclear Power</h2><p>A classic.

He is the author of acclaimed, best-selling biographies of Albert Einstein, Benjamin Franklin, and Henry Kissinger.In a thought-provoking book designed to reconsider the attributes of American leadership, Issacson (Einstein and His Universe), former managing editor of Time and now president of the Aspen Institute, has assembled a group of distinguished historians to address some seminal figures in terms of their vision, principles, flexibility, and pragmatism. Many of the contributors have first-rate r�sum�s in scholarship, letters, and research, including Frances Fitzgerald, Sean Wilentz, Jean Strouse, and Robert Dallek. Quality writing, incisive analysis, and valuable revelations accompany each essay, whether it's Kevin Baker's take on the unpredictable baseball manager John Joseph McGraw, Evan Thomas's emotional deconstruction of Robert F. Kennedy, or Annette Gordon-Reed's perceptive measure of W.E.B. Du Bois. Three standout essays concern the moral and strategic strengths and weaknesses of Gen. George Washington; Joseph, chief of the Nez Perce Indians; and presidents Hoover and FDR. At a time when leadership is lacking, this memorable book culls examples from our past to reveal what makes a person stand above the rest. It's unfortunate that just one of the subjects--civil rights activist Pauli Murray--is a woman. 13 illus. (Oct.) (c) <br>Copyright � PWxyz, LLC.

That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m thinking as I carefully weave my little boat through the ships in the crowded harbor. I&#x2019;ve seen many ports and I&#x2019;ve weathered many storms and good old Boston Harbor is looking right good to me at this moment. Hmmm . . . be wary, though, girl. There&#x2019;s three British warships lying over there at Long Wharf. Got to steer clear of them, for sure, as the men on board could have heard of the price that&#x2019;s on my poor head and might be of a mind to try to collect it. My head, that is . . . Imagine that . . . a reward of two hundred and fifty pounds, and all for the body of one insignificant girl&#x2014; a full Royal Navy captain&#x2019;s pay for a year, and wouldn&#x2019;t some lucky sailor like to nab that?<br>&nbsp;As I clear the end of Long Wharf, I pull my cap further down over my face and sail on. Don&#x2019;t mind me, Sirs. Just a simple fisher lass heading home, nothing more.<br>&nbsp;Now I start working my way over to the land. I&#x2019;m remembering that there&#x2019;s an open bit of gravelly beach between Howard&#x2019;s and Codman&#x2019;s wharves, and that is where I&#x2019;m of a mind to land. The wind is fair and my sail is drawing well and I&#x2019;m cutting neatly through boats and ships that are anchored out. I pull in a bit closer and look over at the warships. They could see me from where they lay, if they cared to look. But who cares about some fishmonger&#x2019;s dutiful daughter out plying her family&#x2019;s trade? That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m thinking. Or hoping. But, oh Sirs&#x2014; you, my fellow countrymen and fellow sailors&#x2014; if only you knew what has happened at Trafalgar, you would not be sitting so peacefully here. It&#x2019;s plain they haven&#x2019;t gotten the word yet.<br>&nbsp;Codman&#x2019;s Wharf passes on my port side and I throw the tiller over and bring the sail in close-hauled. When I hear and feel the scrape of the bottom on my keel, I loose the sail and the Morning Star slips her nose up elegantly onto the beach. Pretty neat sailing, old girl, I&#x2019;m thinking, patting her gunwale affectionately. I know it&#x2019;s been a long trip for the both of us, from Trafalgar to here, that&#x2019;s for sure, and now you just rest.<br>&nbsp;For a moment I sit there in wonder at being back in Boston again, then I go forward and loosen the halyard, letting the sail and its booms collapse to the deck. I&#x2019;m about to gather it in and wrap it up, when there&#x2019;s a noise behind me and I spin around in alarm, my shiv out of my vest and in my hand. By God, they&#x2019;re not going to take me without&#x2014;<br>&nbsp;But it is nothing but a boy. A very ragged and dirty boy, to be sure, but just a boy. He is the very picture of a wharf rat, a breed with which I am very familiar, having once been one myself, back when I lived under London&#x2019;s Blackfriars Bridge as a member in good standing of the Rooster Charlie Gang of Naked Orphans. Blackfriars Bridge was real close to the docks on the Thames, so, yes, I know this kind of boy quite well.<br>&#x201c;Need some help, Missy?&#x201d; he says with hope in his voice. It&#x2019;s plain from the ribs sticking out under his too-short shirt that he hasn&#x2019;t eaten in a while and he looks real willin&#x2019; to earn a penny. Well, I can&#x2019;t argue with that, as I&#x2019;m all for youthful spunk and enterprise. I slide my knife back in my vest.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Well, maybe. Help me stow the sail.&#x201d;<br>He leaps on board to help me wrap the sail around the boom, and we lash it down tight with the mainsheet and secure it to its stay post.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;There, Missy, tight as a drum. Anything else? Polish your brass, shine up your brightwork, varnish your oars?&#x201d;<br>This one is younger than me&#x2014; maybe thirteen, fourteen. His hair is held back with a piece of old twine and I can see both his knees through the rips in the trousers that end raggedly at his calves. He is, of course, barefoot.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;You can see, young Master Wharf Rat, that the Morning Star has neither brass work nor brightwork, nor do her oars need varnishing,&#x201d; I say severely, in my best Naval Officer voice, &#x201c;but you may, if you wish to earn a penny, watch over her till I return, which might be today, or might be tomorrow. If you know a place where she can be moored . . .&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, yes, Missy. See that pier over by the market? I&#x2019;ll tie it up there. So many fishing boats go in and out of there that they&#x2019;ll never notice us.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; I say. I dig in the purse that hangs by my side and pull out a penny and flip it to him. &#x201c;Go spend this on something to eat first and then tend to moving her. And mark me&#x2014;&nbsp; This is the Morning Star and she is a her, not an it. Do you get that?&#x201d;<br>He nods.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;You can do it by yourself?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Oh, yes, Missy, I&#x2019;m a thoroughgoing seaman! I&#x2019;ll get her anywhere you need her.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;I give a quick snort. &#x201c;Very well, Seaman . . . What is your name, boy?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Tanner, Missy.

Numbered among Dickens, Trollope, and other giants of the age as a novelist, MacDonald ended his career with over fifty books ranging from fantastical literature, to children's stories, to critical essays, and numerous novels. In addition to writing, MacDonald lectured extensively. </p> <p>MacDonald's fiction combined the man's immense spiritual understanding with his innate storytelling ability. His works have influenced writers like C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien, and many others. </p> <p><b>Michael Phillips</b> is an author, editor, publisher, and bookseller.

He was both courageous and cultured. His passions were architecture, horses, and women. And, along with the whole courtly world of King Charles I and his cavaliers, he was doomed to failure. <br>Cavendish was a master of <i>man�ge</i> (the art of teaching horses to dance) and obsessed with building beautiful houses in the latest style. He taught Charles I's son to ride, and was the general of the king's army in the north during the Civil War. Famously defeated at the Battle of Marston Moor in 1644, he went into a long continental exile before returning to England in triumph on the restoration of King Charles II to the throne in 1660.<br>This is the story of one remarkable man, but it is also a rich evocation of what sustained him--his extraordinary household. Lucy Worsley brings to life the complex and fascinating hierarchies among the inhabitants of the great houses of the seventeenth-century, painting a picture of conspiracy, sexual intrigue, clandestine marriage, and gossip. From Ben Jonson and Anthony Van Dyck to long-forgotten servants, <i>Cavalier</i> is a brilliant illumination of the stately home and its inhabitants. The household's cacophony and stink as well as its ceremony and splendor come to life.</p><p>The Chief Curator of the Historic Royal Palaces (including Hampton Court and the Tower of London), <b>Lucy Worsley</b> is a leading young historian. She has been researching the story of William Cavendish and his household for more than ten years, and is the author of the English Heritage guide to Bolsover Castle, his principal home.Worsley, the chief curator of Britain's Historic Royal Palaces, closely examines the life of 17th-century English aristocrat William Cavendish, a champion of poetry, music, horses, women and architecture, with reference to numerous primary sources including a rich body of his estate papers, letters and poems. Every detail of Cavendish's universe comes to life, from architect John Smithson's designs for his exquisite home to the job descriptions and diets of the building site's laborers. Also vividly described is a nasty household plot against Cavendish's much younger second wife and a costly entertainment staged by Cavendish to curry favor with Charles I. It succeeded, and the King made William earl, marquis, his heir's tutor and a Civil War general, a commission beyond Cavendish's abilities. After a key battle of the war ended in disaster, Cavendish fled to the continent, lived in relative poverty and was branded a coward, but his fortunes rebounded under Charles II, who minted him duke of Newcastle. Although fascinating, this diligently documented account reveals its roots as a doctoral thesis. 16-page color insert, b&amp;w illus. <i>(Oct. 20)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He couldn't afford any. That was why he decided to keep walking right past the Range Rider bar and the blaring Western music, through the darkness that shrouded the long-ago abandoned buildings of his hometown.<br><br>A sliver of moon hung over the top of the mountains among a plethora of stars in a midnight sky bigger than any he swore he'd ever seen. He could smell spring in the pines and on the snow-fed water as the creek rushed past town.<br><br>When he was a boy he used to imagine what Beartooth, Montana, had been like in the late 1800s. A gold-rush boomtown at the feet of the Crazy Mountains. Back then there'd been hotels and boarding-houses, a half dozen saloons, livery stables, assaying offices and several general stores.<br><br>Once the gold played out, the town died down to what it was today: one bar, a general store, a cafe, a church and a post office. Many of the original buildings still stood, though, ghostly remains of what once had been.<br><br>As isolated as the town was, Beartooth had survived when many Montana gold-rush towns had completely disappeared. Towns died off the same way families did, he thought, mindful of his own. His roots ran deep here in the shadow of the Crazies, as the locals called the wild, magnificent mountain range.<br><br>Over the years two stories took hold about how the Crazy Mountains got their name. Native Americans believed anyone who went into the frightening, fierce winds that blew out of the inhospitable rugged peaks was crazy. Another story was about a frontier woman who had wandered into the mountains. By the time she was found, the story went, she'd gone crazy.<br><br>Jack believed being this close to all that wildness could make anyone crazy. His great-grandfather used to tell stories about gunfights and bar brawls on this very street. Of course, his great-grandfather had been right in the middle of it.<br><br>Blame the mountains or genetics&#x2014;this was his family legacy. Trouble was in his genes as if branded to his DNA. But hadn't he proven tonight that he could change? He'd been tempted to stop in for just one beer at the Range Rider. Why not, since it was his first night back in town?<br><br>But a two-year stint at Deer Lodge, Montana State Prison, for rustling a prized bull, had made him see that it was time to break some of those old family traditions. Didn't matter that he hadn't taken the bull. He'd been living as wild and crazy as the wilderness around Beartooth and it had caught up with him. He'd just made it easy for whoever had framed him.<br><br>He'd had two years to think about who'd set him up for the fall and what he was going to do about it. Or whether he was going to forget the past and move on with his life. Not that prison had been that bad. He'd spent those couple of years on the prison's cattle ranch, riding fence, chasing cattle, doing what he had since he'd been old enough to ride.<br><br>But now he was back in the only place that had ever been home.<br><br>A pickup roared past with a glow-in-the-dark bumper sticker that read: Keep Honking, I'm Reloading. Jack breathed in the night and the scent of dust along the narrow paved road, which turned to gravel just past the abandoned filling station and garage at the edge of town.<br><br>As the truck's engine roar died off, he heard raised voices ahead, coming from the alleyway between the Branding Iron Cafe and the skeletal stone remains of what had been the Beartooth Hotel.<br><br>As his eyes adjusted, he saw a man standing in the ambient light of the cafe sign. At first he didn't see the second figure. Jack caught only a few phrases, just enough to realize the man was threatening someone he had pressed against the stone wall of the cafe. It was too dark to see who, though.<br><br>"I've been looking for you," the man said. "I just didn't expect to find you here." The voice didn't sound familiar. Even after being gone for two years, Jack figured he probably still knew most everyone in this part of the county. Few new people moved here. Even fewer left.<br><br>Good sense told him to keep walking. Whatever was going on, it had nothing to do with him. The last thing he wanted to do was get involved in some drunken fight in an alley his first night home.<br><br>Earlier tonight he'd moved his few belongings into a small log cabin on the edge of town in the dense pines. The place was habitable and only a short walk from the cafe and the Beartooth General Store. It would work fine for the time being. He wasn't sure he was ready to go out to the family homestead just yet.<br><br>Walking on past the alley, Jack congratulated himself on staying clear of trouble tonight. He would have kept going&#x2014;at least that's what he told himself&#x2014;if he hadn't heard her voice.<br><br>"Let go of me." Definitely a woman's voice. "I already told you. You have the wrong woman. But if you don't leave me alone&#x2014;"<br><br>Jack had already turned to go back when he heard a smack and her cry of pain. With a curse, he took off down the dark alley.<br><br>The man turned when he heard Jack's boot soles pounding the hard-packed earth, coming fast in his direction. "Butt out. This isn't any of your bus&#x2014;" That's all the man got out before Jack hit him.<br><br>The man was a lot bigger than he'd appeared from a distance. He had the arms of someone who'd spent a lot of time lifting weights. Jack caught sight of jail-house tattoos on the man's massive arms below the sleeves of his dark T-shirt, and swore. He was already thinking that getting beat up wasn't exactly what he had in mind for his first night home. That was if he didn't get himself killed.<br><br>The man staggered back into a slice of darkness, rubbing his jaw. He'd lost his Western hat when Jack had hit him. The hat lay on the ground between them.<br><br>"You just messed with the wrong man, cowboy," the stranger said.<br><br>Jack couldn't have agreed more as he braced himself for the man's attack. He'd been in his share of fist-fights in his younger days and figured at thirty-one he could still hold his own&#x2014;at least for a little while. He just hoped the man wasn't armed. That thought came somewhat late.<br><br>But to his surprise, the man looked past him in the direction of the woman, then turned, retreating into the pitch-blackness at the back of the alley. Odd, Jack thought, since the man hadn't even bothered to pick up his hat. Was he going to get his gun? Jack didn't want to find out. But a moment later, a vehicle door opened and slammed, an engine revved and the driver took off.<br><br>Jack leaned down and picked up the Western straw hat from the dirt before turning to the woman. "Are you all right?"<br><br>As she stepped away from the wall and into the diffused light from the cafe's sign, he was taken by surprise. She appeared to be close to his own age, and definitely not someone he knew since she was dressed in jogging gear. No one in Beartooth ran&#x2014;unless there was a bear after her. No one wore Lycra, either&#x2014;at least not in public.<br><br>But that was the least of it. Dark hair framed the face of an angel, while ice-cold fury shone in her dark eyes. It took him a moment to realize that her anger was directed at him.<br><br>"What do you think you're doing?" she demanded.<br><br>"I beg your pardon?"<br><br>"I can take care of myself," she said, snatching the hat from his fingers. "I didn't need you coming to my defense." She started to storm down the alley in the direction the man had gone.<br><br>Jack mentally kicked himself for getting involved in what now appeared to be a lover's quarrel. He should have known better. Just as he should have known to let well enough alone and let the woman leave without another word.<br><br>"From what I heard, it sure didn't sound like you didn't need my help," he said to her retreating back.<br><br>She stopped and turned to look back at him. Her eyes narrowed into slits as she stepped toward him, back into the faint glow of the cafe sign. "What you <strong><em>heard?</em> </strong>What exactly is it you think you heard?"<br><br>He raised both hands and took a step back. "Nothing. I should have just left you alone to take care of yourself."<br><br>"Yes, you should have."<br><br>He nodded. "I won't make that mistake again."<br><br>With that, he turned and walked away, shaking his head at his attempt at chivalry. Still, he couldn't help but think about the slash of red on her one perfect cheek where the man had obviously hit her. Well, whoever she was, like the man she'd been arguing with, she wasn't from around here.<br><br>He told himself he wouldn't be crossing either of their paths again&#x2014;which was just fine with him.<br><br>"Welcome home," he mumbled to himself as he headed for his cabin.<br>Sheriff Frank Curry shoved back his Stetson as he watched the assistant coroner inspect the body. The sun was high and hot, another beautiful spring day in southern Montana. A breeze stirred the new leaves of the cottonwoods along the crystal-clear Yellowstone River. In the distance, the snowcapped peaks of the Crazy Mountains gleamed like fields of diamonds.<br><br>A fisherman had stumbled across the body in the weeds this morning after hooking into a nice-sized cutthroat. He was trying to land the fish when he'd practically fallen over the dead man.<br><br>From a nearby limb that hung out over the water, a crow cawed, drawing Frank's attention away from the body for a moment. The bird's dark wings flapped before it settled its black, beady eyes on him, as if to say he'd seen it all and could tell volumes if only Frank were capable of understanding a bird.<br><br>The crow cawed once more and flew off as Assistant Coroner Charlie Brooks stepped out of the weeds, rubbing the back of his neck. He was a short, squat man with timber-thick legs and a bald cue-ball of a head.<br><br>"I'd say he was killed sometime in the wee hours of this morning. Cause of death? Strangulation." Charlie, like a lot of coroners, was a huge mystery fan. "The body hasn't been here more than a few hours. Dumped, I would imagine, from up there." He pointed to an embankment that led up to a gravel access road into Otter Creek. "Appears he rolled down, to come to rest at the edge of the river."<br><br>Frank nodded&#x2014;that had been his opinion as well. That was why he had one of his deputies up on the road making plaster casts of the tire prints closest to the edge of the embankment.<br><br>"Going to need to take some fingerprints once you get him to the morgue," he told the coroner. "No identification on him that I could find."<br><br>"We'll put him on ice until you can get a positive ID and notify next of kin."<br><br>Frank figured it shouldn't take long. The man had spent some time in a penitentiary somewhere, given the array of prison tattoos on his arms and neck. His prints should be on file.<br><br>"What's that he was killed with?" the coroner asked. "Appears to be some kind of fancy braided rope."<br><br>"Hitched horsehair," Frank said. "They make a lot of this up at Montana State Prison. That's why around here, hitchin' is synonymous with doing time. You ever heard the legend of Tom Horn? It's said that he was hung with a rope he hitched while doing time in a territorial prison."<br><br>"Horsehair dyed bright colors, huh? I'll be damned."<br><br>A retired doctor, Charlie was new to Montana after living all his life in the big city.<br><br>Standing back, Frank watched as the assistant coroner and one of the local EMTs put the victim into a body bag and carried him to the fishing-access parking lot. In the distance he could hear the thrum of traffic on Interstate 90. Closer, a trout rose out of the water, the splash sending sparkling droplets into the morning air.<br><br>Frank watched the wavelets from the fish spread across the smooth surface. Murder had its own ripple effect. Shaking off the thought, he followed the path the body had made tumbling from the road. He hoped to find a wallet or something that might have fallen out of the man's pockets.<br><br>Fortunately, in Montana, few people littered, so there were only a half dozen rusted beer cans, a couple of plastic water bottles and several pieces of dew-wet cardboard in the weeds. He was about to give up when he spotted what looked like a scrap of white paper caught high in the grass.<br><br>His hands still covered by the latex gloves he'd donned earlier, he plucked the scrap up, surprised to see that it was a photograph folded in half. Yellowed with age, the snapshot was also cracked down the middle because of the fold and worn at the edges as if it had been handled a lot. The people lined up in the shot appeared to be a family, the youngest still in Mama's arms.<br><br>Frank turned the photo over and saw that something had been written on the back. The faded marks were impossible to read. But what made his heart beat a little faster was the realization that the photo hadn't been in the grass long. It wasn't even that damp from the morning dew.<br><br>All his instincts told him it had belonged to the unidentified dead man.<br><br></p><h2>The Fountainhead (60th Anniversary Edition)</h2><p>In a brand-new Plume hardcover edition, here is the story of an intransigent young architect, Howard Roark, of his violent battle against a mindless status quo, and of his explosive love affair with a beautiful woman who worships him yet struggles to defeat him. In order to build his kind of buildings according to his own standards, Roark must fight against every variant of human corruption, including an unprincipled, parasitic rival; a powerful publisher of yellow journalism; and, worst of all, the country's leading humanitarian and power-luster ("Everything that can't be ruled, must go"). <br><br> Epochal, impassioned, and hugely controversial, <i>The Fountainhead</i> - with more than six million copies in print - has become the classic American statement of individualism. Rand shows why every great innovator was hated and denounced, and why man's ego is the fountainhead of human greatness. <br><br> Brilliantly written and daringly original, here - as resonant today as it was sixty years ago - is a novel about a hero.</p><p><i>The Fountainhead</i> has become an enduring piece of literature, more popular now than when published in 1943. On the surface, it is a story of one man, Howard Roark, and his struggles as an architect in the face of a successful rival, Peter Keating, and a newspaper columnist, Ellsworth Toohey. But the book addresses a number of universal themes: the strength of the individual, the tug between good and evil, the threat of fascism. The confrontation of those themes, along with the amazing stroke of Rand's writing, combine to give this book its enduring influence.Ayn Rand is the author of <i>Atlas Shrugged</i>. Her first novel, <i>We the Living</i>, was published in 1936, followed by <i>Anthem</i>. With the publication of <i>The Fountainhead</i> in 1943, she achieved a spectacular and enduring success. Through her novels and nonfiction writing, Rand - who died in 1982 - maintains a lasting influence on popular and scholarly thought.</p><h2>Abraham Lincoln and the Second American Revolution</h2><p>James McPherson has emerged as one of America's finest historians. <em>Battle Cry of Freedom</em>, his Pulitzer Prize-winning account of the Civil War, was a national bestseller that Hugh Brogan, in <em>The New York Times Book Review</em>, called "history writing of the highest order." In that volume, McPherson gathered in the broad sweep of events, the political, social, and cultural forces at work during the Civil War era. Now, in <em>Abraham Lincoln and the Second American Revolution</em>, he offers a series of thoughtful and engaging essays on aspects of Lincoln and the war that have rarely been discussed in depth.<br> McPherson again displays his keen insight and sterling prose as he examines several critical themes in American history. He looks closely at the President's role as Commander-in-Chief of the Union forces, showing how Lincoln forged a national military strategy for victory. He explores the importance of Lincoln's great rhetorical skills, uncovering how--through parables and figurative language--he was uniquely able to communicate both the purpose of the war and a new meaning of liberty to the people of the North. In another section, McPherson examines the Civil War as a Second American Revolution, describing how the Republican Congress elected in 1860 passed an astonishing blitz of new laws (rivaling the first hundred days of the New Deal), and how the war not only destroyed the social structure of the old South, but radically altered the balance of power in America, ending 70 years of Southern power in the national government.<br> The Civil War was the single most transforming and defining experience in American history, and Abraham Lincoln remains the most important figure in the pantheon of our mythology. These graceful essays, written by one of America's leading historians, offer fresh and unusual perspectives on both.</p><p>7 1-hour cassettes<br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>James M.

Serafina is about to be crowned heir to her mother's throne. She knows what is expected of her, but is she really ready to rule? That is the question Sera must answer when tragedy strikes and her kingdom and parents are taken captive. Barely escaping with her life and her freedom, she is left with no choice but to seek out the ancient force-no more than a legend, really-that has haunted her dreams but may, at least, provide answers. A fantastic addition to the genre of mermaids, this book will also appeal to readers of action and those who appreciate usurped leaders taking back their kingdom. It starts with a common enough concept: a royal girl who is worried about her betrothal and about love. Donnelly then adds layers of complexity to the tale and weaves her story into that of Atlantis. Friendship, trust, and responsibility are major themes as Sera struggles to grasp that she is really her kingdom's only hope. Quick-witted, loveable characters and a well-planned fantasy world make this an all-encompassing book. Readers will eagerly await future volumes and the answers they will provide.-Kristi Sadowski. VOYA"<br><br>Gr 5-8 Donnelly, perhaps best-known for her lush and emotionally resonant historical fiction, tries her hand at middle-grade fantasy. Not one to dip a toe into a genre, she dives right in with a four-volume underwater saga of the mer, complete with four thousand years of Atlantean history and magic. In Deep Blue, readers meet Serafina, a 16-year-old mermaid and heir apparent to the realm, on the day of her betrothal as part of her Dokim ceremony. All goes swimmingly, despite her nervousness and qualms about her intended, until her mother, the ruler of Miromara, is felled by a sniper's arrow. Serafina's worries take a more serious, geopolitical turn as she and her best friend, Neela, are on the run and seeking to avoid an all-out war among the mer nations. The "merlfriends" have been summoned by the same magical dream and are drawn to search for four other mermaids who will join together and save the world from a dark, evil force. There's a lot going on, yet despite the convoluted backstory and the dreaded "terragogg" (human) degradation of the oceans, everything gets a light, surface treatment. There's little character development, beyond the protagonist, or sense of real danger, and even the spells that abound seem to exist for expediency and nick-of-time escapes. All that said, the story is appropriately cinematic, and perhaps with a few songs added to the mix, could be adapted into an animated Disney hit. Luann Toth, School Library Journal SLJ"<br><br>Donnelly (Revolution) opens the four-book Waterfire Saga with a richly imagined novel set in an undersea world of mermaids descended from the lost citizens of Atlantis. Serafina is heir to the Mediterranean realm of Miromara, but just as she is about to be recognized as its future ruler in the high-pressure Dokim ceremony, a devastating attack throws her life into flux. Led by cryptic dreams they share, Serafina and fellow princess Neela try to evade the conquering forces while seeking four other powerful young mermaids. Donnelly blends references to ancient myth and human language (especially Latin), with a mermaid culture that has its own magic, lore, and slang ("currensea," "merlfriend") that may strike some readers as too cutesy. Themes of conquering fear and believing in oneself are woven throughout, along with an acknowledgment of humans' environmental impact on the sea and its inhabitants. Despite the high stakes and a few frightening moments, the story is never overserious; it's just right for readers who have grown up with, but aged out of, The Little Mermaid and the Disney Fairies franchise. Ages 10 14. PW"<br><br>The award-winning author teams up with Disney to deliver a book seemingly tailor-made for commercial success. Imagine an undersea world populated by mers of every type: Blond, blue-tailed seafolk exist, but the variety described goes far behind that stereotype; some are crab-legged or stranger. It's a complex world, created magically as Atlantis fell. Now, the evil behind the fall threatens again, and this time it's teamed up with a terragogg (human) bent on destroying ecosystems. Six mermaids have been summoned in dreams to save a world suddenly under attack. Exposition-heavy descriptions of a sometimes-nonsensical society (dresses and other human accoutrements that can't possibly enhance undersea life are described in downright cinematic detail, and mer-derived slang-for example, "merlfriend"-comes across as forced) dominate the beginning. They eventually give way to a plot-driven tale of prophesied saviors getting to know each other and preparing for an epic battle (and several more volumes). The merls have little to no personality (protagonist Serafina somewhat excepted), but then, this book is aimed at upper-preteen/early-teen readers who might enjoy finding themselves in the text. The diversity of the cast (white, black, Asian and Indian are all represented among the chosen) deserves some props. Readers who put aside the sense that they are being primed for products and just imagine the movie it ought to be may find it palatable enough. (Fantasy. 11-14) Kirkus"<br><br>As the heir to the underwater kingdom of Miromara, mermaid Serafina prepares for the ceremonial testing that will prove her fitness as a ruler and ensure her betrothal to the crown prince of a neighboring realm. Unfortunately, just as the successful ceremony comes to an end, Serafina and her people are attacked, her mother and father are killed, and Serafina and her childhood friend Neela are forced to flee. The girls realize then that they've both been having prophetic dreams of a great evil disrupting the underwater world, and they follow the instructions in their vision to search for four other young mermaids who may hold the keys to defeating this new threat. A skilled hand in historical fiction, Donnelly (author of Revolution, BCCB 11/10 and A Northern Light, BCCB 7/03) incorporates elements of classic history and the myth of Atlantis into her construction of this fantasy under the sea, but she also makes room for modern touches, especially in the details of Serafina's daily life. The plot, however, is overly stuffed, with the girls facing off not only with several villainous creatures but also traveling through an alternate mirror world that is discordant with the rest of the underwater mythology; an increasingly unwieldy cast of characters also makes it difficult to determine who's a significant player and who's just emotional bait to add drama. Still, the relationship between the two friends is often touching, and their banter has a cozy intimacy that will likely resonate with young girls and their BFFs. Hand this to middle-graders who have outgrown Disney's The Little Mermaid but who aren't ready for the darkness of Porter's Lost Voices (BCCB 9/11). KQG BCCB"<br><br>Just when Sera, the heir to the throne of a vast underwater mermaid matriarchy, is basking in the success of perfectly performing the rites of ascendancy, her city is ambushed, her parents are killed, and-now officially but reluctantly Regina-she's on the run from powerful forces seeking to destroy much more than just her city. If that weren't enough, Sera's been having terrifyingly vivid dreams, which summon her and five other teenage mermaids to a mysterious coven of river witches in order to decipher an ancient prophesy and unlock their hidden powers. Best-selling Donnelly (Revolution, 2010) builds an alluring mermaid civilization and history, filled with painterly descriptions of Sera's underwater palace and its unearthly architecture, her sumptuous wardrobe, and the menagerie of half-human, half-marine animal denizens. There's also plenty of romantic tension with handsome mermen, strife between merls (that's girl mermaids) from rival regions, and some powerful female friendships amid the fast-paced plot, filled with wondrous magic. This series opener raises far more questions than it answers, but it lays a promising groundwork for the forthcoming volumes.

And James Stevenson traces this crucial era with precision, bringing to light facts which are often misinterpreted or shrouded in legend. (The catacombs, for example, were not sanctuaries for the persecuted faithful.) In this study, we are able to perceive an accurate portrait of the lives - and deaths - of those who participated in the formation of the Church. Stevenson looks at how and why the catacombs were constructed, explores the evolution of these burial sites over the centuries, and shows how they tell of their builders&#39; motives and beliefs. He also explains how the artwork found in these crypts reveals the strong scriptural influences on the fledgling Church. The Catacombs makes fascinating reading for lay person and scholar alike. Its wealth of information is combined with 144 illustrations to comprise an exhaustive yet concise survey of an epochal period in early Christianity. --- from book&#39;s back cover</p><p></p><h2>The Awakening Heart: My Continuing Journey to Love</h2><p>The author of Embraced by the Light discusses the lessons she learned during her near-death experience and in subsequent visions and visitations, presenting for readers a guide to spirituality and unconditional love.</p><p><p>Betty J.

It might be categorized as a &#39;new age&#39; or philosophy book, like The Celestine Prophecy, since it focuses on his spiritual training and their teachings in a novel-like format. Hard to believe, but interestingly, the sub-tropical region amongst the Himalayas that he describes finding, was later documented by explorers from National Geographic, the &#39;covered up&#39; (there is still evidence of this). Also interesting is that the author was apparently mentioned in the Edgar Cayce readings (the famous American psychic whose books have sold millions of copies), as someone who would one day bring an important message to the world.</p><p></p><h2>The Sacred Journey</h2><p>This memoir reflects on key moments of the author&#39;s early life, from childhood to his entering seminary, that reveal how God speaks to us in a variety of ways every moment of every day.</p><p>"A child takes life as it comes because he has no other way of taking it," Frederick Buechner writes in this first of his autobiographical books. With this statement he attempts to explore the event that is at the center of this book, and which forms the (missing) center around which so much of Buechner's fiction and essays take shape: the suicide of his father when he was 10 and his brother 8.<p> As with much of Buechner's work, there is a movement in this narrative from suffering to grace, a grace that comes in unexpected ways and places. Here it comes through the preacher George Buttrick on a Sunday sermon: Jesus refused Satan's crown, Buttrick said, but "he is crowned in the heart of the people who believe in him. And that inward coronation takes place ... 'among confession, and tears, and great laughter.'" It was when he heard this final statement, Buechner writes, that something turned over for him, and led him to speak to Buttrick and ultimately led him--driven literally by Buttrick--to Union Theological Seminary. Here in this beautiful book this soul-changing journey across Manhattan stands for "the sacred journey" of a life--and of all of our lives. Whether it ends in truth or dream we cannot know, but Buechner sides with King Rinkitink of Oz who says, "Never question the truth of what you fail to understand, for the world is filled with wonders." <i>--Doug Thorpe</i></p><p>Frederick Buechner, author of more than thirty works of fiction and nonfiction, is an ordained Presbyterian minister.

Reading made him who he is. <br><br>To understand the thrall of fiction, Spufford goes back to his earliest encounters with books, exploring such beloved classics as <i>The Wind in the Willows, The Little House on the Prairie</i>, and the Narnia chronicles. He re-creates the excitement of discovery, writing joyfully of the moment when fuzzy marks on a page become words, which then reveal . . . a dragon. Weaving together child development, personal reflection, and social observation, Spufford shows the force of fiction in shaping a child: how stories allow for escape from pain and for mastery of the world, how they shift our boundaries of the sayable, how they stretch the chambers of our imagination.<br><br>Fired by humanity, curiosity, and humor, <i>The Child That Books Built</i> confirms Spufford as a profound and original thinker, evoking in the process the marvel of reading as if for the first time.<br></p><p>Francis Spufford, a London-based journalist and critic, is a contributor to <i>Granta</i> and <i>The Guardian</i>. For his first book, <i>I May Be Some Time</i>, he was named the <i>Sunday Times</i> Young Writer of the Year and received the 1997 Somerset Maugham and Writers' Guild Awards.<br>In this often incisive childhood memoir, a British journalist and award-winning author (I May Be Some Time) recreates his early reading itinerary and pinpoints the universal experiences of the constant young reader. Most important, he understands the escape that books offer a child "More than I wanted books to do anything else, I wanted them to take me away," he writes. He follows with musings on the particular effects created by the books he encountered: the ecstasy and longing of C.S. Lewis's Narnia chronicles, the community created in the Little House on the Prairie series (here Spufford offers interesting asides on how daughter Rose Wilder Lane's arch-conservative politics shaped her mother's books, which she helped write), and the "godsend," at a certain age, of science fiction, particularly that of Ursula Le Guin. Discussions of the ideas of Bettelheim, C.S. Lewis and others are serviceable but pale in effect beside rich evocations of communions with books, such as the pleasing power of libraries, the comfort of reliable Puffin Books, the experience of reading "faster than my understanding had grown" and the inevitable moment when a young reader reaches the "saturation point" and must move beyond children's books. Moments of literary discovery (even for "one-handed" reading of porn) are offered concisely. Readers will luxuriate in the memories of being consumed by books and the ways in which Spufford shows his developing talent as a reader.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Art &amp; Queer Culture</h2><p>&#xfeff;<p><b>An unprecedented survey of over 250 works over 130 years of queer art history</b></p><p><i>Art and Queer Culture</i> features work by famous artists such as Andy Warhol and Robert Mapplethorpe alongside that of AIDS activists, lesbian separatists, and pre-Stonewall photographers and scrapbook-keepers who did not regard themselves as artists at all.</p><p>In a compact, reader-friendly format, this volume traces a spectacular history of queer life and creativity in the modern age.

A prequel to Jane Eyre, Rhys&#x2019;s revolutionary work reimagined the story of Bertha Rochester&#x2015;the misunderstood &#x201c;madwoman in the attic&#x201d; who was driven to insanity by cruelties beyond her control. <em>The Blue Hour</em> performs a similar exhumation of Rhys&#x2019;s life, which was haunted by demons from within and without. Its examination of Rhys&#x2019;s pain and loss charts her desperate journey from the jungles of Dominica to a British boarding school, and then into an adult life scarred by three failed marriages, the deaths of her two children, and her long battle with alcoholism.A mesmerizing evocation of a fragile and brilliant mind, <em>The Blue Hour</em> explores the crucial element that ultimately spared Rhys from the fate of her most famous protagonist: a genius that rescued her, again and again, from the abyss.20 photos</p><p>British biographer Lilian Pizzichini has worked for the Literary Review and the Times Literary Supplement.*Starred Review* The pain expressed in&nbsp;Rhys&#x2019; sexually frank, devastating fiction is so authentic, it suggests firsthand experience of the bleakest aspects of womanhood in a misogynist society. Ahead of her time and forever dispossessed,&nbsp;deeply unconventional and intensely creative, Rhys, born Ella Gwendoline Rees Williams in sunny Dominica in 1890 and sent to boarding school in chilly England, did, indeed, draw on her own life in such indelible works as Good Morning, Midnight (1939) and Wide Sargasso Sea (1966). Her harrowing story has been told in full by Carole Angier in a 1990 biography. What Pizzichini&#x2014;who wrote about her grandfather,&nbsp; a notorious London gangster, in Dead Man&#x2019;s Wages (2002)&#x2014;achieves in this page-turner is a piercingly empathic psychological portrait. Beginning in the West Indies, where Rhys &#x201c;spent much of her childhood screaming,&#x201d; up to her death in 1979, Pizzichini decodes the volatile chemistry of Rhys&#x2019;&nbsp;watchfulness&nbsp;and tenacity, hatred of hypocrisy and attraction to criminality, and addictions to conflict and alcohol. As Pizzichini perceptively tracks Rhys the chorus girl, kept woman, wife of three feckless crooks, lover of Ford Maddox Ford, and survivor of breakdowns and incarceration, a world-altering writer of ruthless honesty emerges from the flames. --Donna Seaman</p><h2>Build It Better Yourself</h2><p>The gardener and homesteader is provided with photographs, plans, and step-by-step instructions for constructing outbuildings, greenhouses, fences, beehives, bridges, garden carts, chicken houses, and other utilitarian items</p><p></p><h2>InuYasha, Vol. 8</h2><p>Follows the adventures of high school student Kagome and the feral half-demon dog-boy Inu-Yasha as they join forces to reclaim the &#34;Jewel of Four Souls&#34; to prevent evil mortals and demons from using its terrifying powers.</p><p>The spotlight on Rumiko Takahashi's career began in 1978 when she won an honorable mention in Shogakukan's annual New Comic Artist Contest for Those Selfish Aliens.

Her coat was warm but she had not worn gloves. There was a distinct chill this early November morning.<br> <br>She had twisted her long auburn hair and fastened it at the back of her head. Now only wisps of it blew around her face. Tall, like her father, and slender, like her mother, she had realized after graduating from college that the life of a teacher was not the way for her to go. Instead, she enrolled in the Fashion Institute of Technology and after receiving a degree had been hired by Glady Harper, the doyenne of interior decorating among the wealthy and the socially ambitious.<br> <br>Elaine always joked that she had been named after her paternal great-aunt, a childless widow who was considered extremely well-to-do. The problem was that Auntie Elaine Marsha, an animal lover, had left most of her money to various animal shelters and very little to her relatives.<br> <br>As Lane explained it, &#x201c;Elaine is a very nice name and so is Marsha, but I never felt like Elaine Marsha.&#x201d; As a child she had unintentionally solved that problem by mispronouncing her name as &#x201c;Lane,&#x201d; and it had stuck.<br> <br>For some reason she was thinking about that as she walked from Second Avenue to Fifth and then down to Twenty-Third Street. I feel good, she thought. I love being here, right now, at this moment, in this place. I love New York. I don&#x2019;t think I could ever live anyplace else. At least I wouldn&#x2019;t want to. But she probably would decide to move to the suburbs soon. Katie would start kindergarten next September, and the private schools in Manhattan were too pricey for her.<br> <br>That reflection brought a familiar stab of pain. Oh, Ken, she thought. If only you had lived. Pushing back the memory, she opened the door of the Flatiron Building and took the elevator to the fourth floor.<br> <br>Although it was only twenty of nine, Glady Harper was already there, as she had expected. The other employees, the receptionist and the bookkeeper, usually arrived by two minutes of nine. Glady did not forgive lateness.<br> <br>Lane stopped at the door of Glady&#x2019;s private office. &#x201c;Hi, Glady.&#x201d;<br> <br>Glady looked up. As usual her steel-gray hair looked as though she had not taken the trouble to brush it. Her wiry figure was clothed in a black sweater and slacks. Lane knew that Glady had a closet full of exactly the same outfits and that her passion for color and texture and design was reserved exclusively for the interiors of homes and offices. Sixty years old, divorced for twenty years, she was called &#x201c;Glady&#x201d; by her friends and employees. One of her fabric suppliers had joked &#x201c;glad-she&#x2019;s-not&#x201d; would have been a more appropriate nickname, a remark that cost him a lucrative contract.<br> <br>Glady did not waste time on greeting her. &#x201c;Come in, Lane,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I want to talk something over with you.&#x201d;<br> <br>What did I do wrong? Lane asked herself as, following the command, she walked into the office and settled in one of the antique Windsor chairs in front of Glady&#x2019;s desk.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve had a request from a new client, or maybe I should say an old client, and I&#x2019;m not sure if I want to get involved.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lane raised her eyebrows. &#x201c;Glady, you always say that if you sense a client is going to be difficult, the job isn&#x2019;t worth it.&#x201d; Not that you&#x2019;re not difficult, she added silently. The first thing Glady did when she took on a client was to go through the home with a cart and ruthlessly get rid of any object she considered to be junk.<br> <br>&#x201c;This one is different,&#x201d; Glady said, troubled. &#x201c;Ten years ago, I did the interior design on a mansion in Greenwich when Parker Bennett bought it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Parker Bennett!&#x201d; Lane thought of the headlines about the fund manager who had cheated his clients out of billions of dollars. He had disappeared from his sailboat just before the theft was discovered. It was believed he had committed suicide, even though his body had never been found.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s not quite him I&#x2019;m talking about,&#x201d; Glady said. &#x201c;The Bennetts&#x2019; son, Eric, called me. The government has clawed back every penny it can from whatever Parker Bennett had. Now the house is being sold. What&#x2019;s left in there has no real value and they&#x2019;re going to let Bennett&#x2019;s wife, Anne, take out enough to furnish a condominium. Eric said his mother is absolutely indifferent to everything and he&#x2019;d like me to do it for him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Can he afford to pay you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He was very up-front. He said he had read that the biggest commission I ever received was from his father&#x2019;s &#x2018;spare no expense&#x2019; instructions to me. He&#x2019;s asking me to do it gratis.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And will you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What would you do, Lane?&#x201d;<br> <br>Lane hesitated, then decided not to be ambivalent. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve seen pictures of that poor woman, Anne Bennett. She looks at least twenty years older than she did in the society columns before the fraud was discovered. If I were you, I&#x2019;d do it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Harper pressed her lips together and looked up at the ceiling. It was a typical reaction when she was concentrating, whether it was over the exact shade of the fringe on a drapery or a decision like this. &#x201c;I think you&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And it certainly won&#x2019;t take too long to put together enough furniture for a condominium. I understand that it&#x2019;s in a town house development in Montclair, New Jersey. That&#x2019;s not that far from the George Washington Bridge, maybe forty minutes in all. At least there won&#x2019;t be too much travel time.&#x201d;<br> <br>She ripped off a page from the pad and pushed it across the desk to Lane. &#x201c;Here is Eric Bennett&#x2019;s phone number. I gather some small investment adviser gave him a behind-the-scenes job. He had been doing very well at Morgan Stanley, but he resigned after they found out what Daddy Dearest had been up to. Make an appointment with him.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lane carried the page to her own office, sat behind her desk, and began to dial the number on it. A firm, modulated voice answered on the first ring.<br> <br>&#x201c;Eric Bennett,&#x201d; he said.</p><h2>Inventing Freedom: How the English-Speaking Peoples Made the Modern World</h2><p><p>British politician Daniel Hannan's <em>Inventing Freedom</em> is an ambitious account of the historical origin and spread of the principles that have made America great, and their role in creating a sphere of economic and political liberty that is as crucial as it is imperiled.</p><p>According to Hannan, the ideas and institutions we consider essential to maintaining and preserving our freedoms&#x2014;individual rights, private property, the rule of law, and the institutions of representative government&#x2014;are the legacy of a very specific tradition that was born in England and that we Americans, along with other former British colonies, inherited. </p><p>By the tenth century, England was a nation-state whose people were already starting to define themselves with reference to inherited common-law rights.

Rather they are the legacy of a very specific tradition, one that was born in England and that we Americans, along with other former British colonies, inherited.</p><p>The first English kingdoms, as they emerged from the Dark Ages, already had unique characteristics that would develop into what we now call constitutional government. By the tenth century, a thousand years before most modern countries, England was a nation-state whose people were already starting to define themselves with reference to inherited common-law rights.</p><p>The story of liberty is the story of how that model triumphed. How, repressed after the Norman Conquest, it reasserted itself; how it developed during the civil wars of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries into the modern liberal-democratic tradition; how it was enshrined in a series of landmark victories&#x2014;the Magna Carta, the English Civil War, the Glorious Revolution, the U.S. Constitution&#x2014;and how it came to defeat every international rival.</p><p>Yet there was nothing inevitable about it. Anglosphere values could easily have been snuffed out in the 1940s. And they would not be ascendant today if the Cold War had ended differently.</p><p>Today we see those ideas abandoned and scorned in the places where they once went unchallenged. The current U.S. president, in particular, seems determined to deride and traduce the Anglosphere values that the Founders took for granted. <em>Inventing Freedom</em> explains why the extraordinary idea that the state was the servant, not the ruler, of the individual evolved uniquely in the English-speaking world. It is a chronicle of the success of Anglosphere exceptionalism. And it is offered at a time that may turn out to be the end of the age of political freedom.</p><p>Daniel Hannan is a writer and politician.

Sheridan</h2><p>Alongside Ulysses S. Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman, Philip H. Sheridan is the least known of the triumvirate of generals most responsible for winning the Civil War. Yet, before Sherman&#x2019;s famous march through Georgia, it was General Sheridan who introduced scorched-earth warfare to the South, and it was his Cavalry Corps that compelled Robert E. Lee&#x2019;s surrender at Appomattox Courthouse. Sheridan&#x2019;s innovative cavalry tactics and &#x201c;total war&#x201d; strategy became staples of twentieth-century warfare.<p>After the war, Sheridan ruthlessly suppressed the raiding Plains Indians much as he had the Confederates, by killing warriors and burning villages, but he also defended reservation Indians from corrupt agents and contractors.

Retaining all the features that made the original edition so popular with both parents and professionals, &#34;Sensory Integration and the Child&#34; remains the best book on the subject. With a new foreward by Dr. Florence Clark and commentaries by recognized experts in sensory integration, this volume explains sensory integrative dysfunction, how to recognize it, and what to do about it. Helpful tips, checklists, question-and-answer sections, and parent resources make the new edition more informative and useful. Indispensible reading for parents, this book is also an excellent way to improve communication between therapist, parents and teachers. The original edition was the first book to explicate sensory integrative dysfunction, and this edition offers new insights and helpful updates in an easy-to-use format. Dr. A. Jean Ayres began to develop sensory integration theory, as well as the evaluation procedures and intervention strategies that were associated with this framework, in the 1950s. When the book &#34;Sensory Integration and Child&#34; was first published in the late 1970s, many aspects of her work were becoming more widely known. Although she was a dedicated researcher and educator, Dr. Ayres was foremost a therapist who worked tirelessly to help the children and families who to her therapy clinic. Over and over again, she listened to the frustration parents expressed at not understanding their children&#39;s behavior, often followed by relief at having those problems named and explained, and hope when a plan for intervention was offered. Dr. Ayres wrote this book in order to bring a similar sense of relief and hope to families beyond those who were able to come to her clinic. Because she recognized that parents commonly went first to doctors, therapists, and teachers for help with the developmental or educational concerns they had about their children, she also wrote this book to help those professionals assist families as well.

In addition to being a nominee for the Romance Writers of America&#x2019;s RITA� Award, she has received many honors throughout her career, including a Career Achievement Award from <em>Romantic Times</em> and the Borders 2008 Lifetime Achievement Award.</p>Prolific Feehan (<i>Dark Melody</i>, etc.) continues her supernatural Dark series with this 13th installment, the first to feature a female Carpathian. Though Carpathians roam the streets at night and gain strength from feeding on blood, they only kill evildoers and vampires. Transformed into a night creature when she was a child, Destiny is unlike any of Feehan's previous heroines. Her physical strength is equal to that of her Carpathian counterpart, Nicolae Von Shrieder, but she's horrified by what she is and haunted by memories of her parents' brutal murder. Nicolae merged his mind with hers when she was first transformed, and through their mental connection, he taught her how to survive. Now Nicolae must find Destiny and make her his lifemate, or he will succumb to darkness and become a vampire. Feehan's protagonists and prose can be overwrought ("His body was hard and full, aching for her.... and deep within, the crouching beast lifted its head and roared for release"), and inconsistencies litter the text (Destiny can supposedly read Nicolae's mind, but it takes her eons to trust him and stop threatening to kill him). However, the story has sufficient sensuality to keep readers sated, and fans should appreciate Feehan's unusual pairing of two Carpathians. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She lives in Washington, D.C.<p></p><p>Introduction</p><p>A few years ago I was in Seattle signing books at a marvelous independent bookstore called Elliott Bay when I noticed a young man standing by the table, watching me. When the line had dwindled, he finally addressed me. He said he was passing through Seattle, visiting a friend, and he wanted me to know he had lived in Iran until recently. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s useless,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;your talk about books. These people are different from us&#x2014;they&#x2019;re from another world. They don&#x2019;t care about books and such things. It&#x2019;s not like Iran, where we were crazy enough to xerox hundreds of pages of books like <i>Madame Bovary</i> and <i>A Farewell to Arms</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>Before I had time to think of a response, he went on to tell me about the first time he had been arrested, late at night during one of the usual random car searches by the revolutionary militia. He had been taken into custody with his two friends, more for their insolence than for the contraband tapes found in the car. They were kept for forty-eight hours and then released without explanation, after being fined and flogged. There was no denying that a normal day in the life of a young Iranian is very different from that of most young Americans.</p><p>I had heard such stories many times before, but there was something unusual about this young man. He spoke in a casual tone that made what he said all the more poignant, as if he were trying to negate the event by describing it in a nonchalant manner. He said that during the floggings, it was not just the pain but the humiliation that had made him feel for a few moments as if he were leaving his body and becoming a ghost, watching himself being flogged from a distance. &#x201c;It made it easier,&#x201d; he added, &#x201c;as a ghost.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know what you mean,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It was a good survival technique.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It still is,&#x201d; he said, with his knowing smile.</p><p>By now there was a line again, patiently and politely waiting, and I made a silly remark to the effect that perhaps America was a land of ghosts anyway. He did not react to that. Instead he handed me a Post-it note and said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have a book. This is for a friend.&#x201d;</p><p>I signed my name on that orange Post-it and gingerly handed him my card. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s be in touch,&#x201d; I said. He took both the Post-it and the card and of course he never did get in touch. But I never lost track of him completely, because that young man, with his serene smile and his words, revisits me<i> </i>in strange places and seemingly unrelated encounters. He has stayed with me partly because I felt then, as I do now, that I had disappointed him&#x2014;something was expected of me that was not fulfilled. When I realized he was going to haunt me for the foreseeable future, I decided to give him a name: Ramin, in honor of another young man I had known in Iran who told me about a similar experience. All these ghosts&#x2014;how do we fulfill our responsibilities toward them?</p><p>Thinking over what Ramin had said, I found it intriguing that he had suggested not that Americans did not understand <i>our </i>books but that they didn&#x2019;t understand their own. In an oblique way, he had made it seem as if Western literature belonged more to the hankering souls of the Islamic Republic of Iran than to the inhabitants of the land that had given birth to them. How could this be? And yet it is true that people who brave censorship, jail and torture to gain access to books or music or movies or works of art tend to hold the whole enterprise in an entirely different light.</p><p>&#x201c;These people,&#x201d; he had said with his inscrutable smile, &#x201c;are different from us. They don&#x2019;t care about books and such things.&#x201d; Every once in a while, after a talk, during a book signing or over coffee with an old friend, this point will come up, usually as a question: &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you think that literature and books were so important in Iran because there was so much repression there? And don&#x2019;t you think that in a democracy there is no such urgent need for them?&#x201d;</p><p>My impulse now, as then, is to disagree. The majority of people in this country who haunt bookstores, go to readings and book festivals or simply read in the privacy of their homes are not traumatized exiles. Many have seldom left their hometown or state, but does this mean that they do not dream, that they have no fears, that they don&#x2019;t feel pain and anguish and yearn for a life of meaning? Stories are not mere flights of fantasy or instruments of political power and control. They link us to our past, provide us with critical insight into the present and enable us to envision our lives not just as they are but as they should be or might become. Imaginative knowledge is not something you have today and discard tomorrow. It is a way of perceiving the world and relating to it. Primo Levi once said, &#x201c;I write in order to rejoin the community of mankind.&#x201d; Reading is a private act, but it joins us across continents and time.</p><p>But perhaps there is another, more personal reason for my disagreement with Ramin: I cannot imagine myself feeling at home in a place that is indifferent to what has become my true home, a land with no borders and few restrictions, which I have taken to calling &#x201c;the Republic of Imagination.&#x201d; I think of it as Nabokov&#x2019;s &#x201c;somehow, somewhere&#x201d; or Alice&#x2019;s backyard, a world that runs parallel to the real one, whose occupants need no passport or documentation. The only requirements for entry are an open mind, a restless desire to know and an indefinable urge to escape the mundane.</p><p>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�</p><p>Long before I made America my home, I inhabited its fiction, its poetry, its music and films. My first fictional journey to America took place when I was about seven, when my English tutor in Tehran introduced me to <i>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</i>. Our main text was a book with simple stories about a pair of American siblings, predictably a girl and a boy. One peculiar feature of these two fiercely clean and well-groomed urchins was that no matter what happened to them, their expressions were fixed in a perpetual smile. I knew their names (was it Jack and Jill? Dick and Jane?), their last names (the Smiths? the Joneses? the Partridges?), where they lived, their daily routine, their school. None of these small and essential details have stayed with me. There was little in their world that made me want to know these smiling, immaculately groomed children any better. The only thing I remember about that book, the one thing that was slightly interesting, was its cover: gritty to the touch, with an image of the two siblings foregrounded on a dark green background.</p><p>Near the end of each session, my tutor would close our exercise book and make her way to the kitchen, from which she would emerge with a glass of cherry sherbet and a worn copy of <i>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. </i>She read only a few pages each time, keeping me in suspense, impatient for our next meeting. Sometimes she would tell me stories from the book or have me read a short passage. I was mesmerized by the orphan Dorothy, who lived in the middle of a flat gray landscape somewhere in the middle of nowhere with her dour and hardworking aunt and uncle and whose only cheerful companion was her dog, Toto. What would happen to her when a cyclone lifted her up with her house, with Toto trapped inside, and landed them in a magical place called Oz? Like millions of children, I impatiently followed Dorothy and her growing group of friends in search of the mighty Wizard of Oz, the only person who could give the Scarecrow a mind, the Tin Man a heart and the Lion courage, and make possible Dorothy&#x2019;s journey home.</p><p>Had I been able to formulate my first impressions of the United States, I might have said that there was a place in America called Kansas, where people could find a magic land at the heart of a cyclone. Because that was the first time I had heard the word &#x201c;cyclone,&#x201d; I can honestly say that <i>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz </i>taught me both its real and imagined meanings. Kansas and Omaha were soon followed by a river called Mississippi and many more cities, rivers, forests, lakes and people&#x2014;the orderly suburban households of Nancy Drew, the frontier towns of <i>Little House on the Prairie</i> and stormy plantations of <i>Gone with the Wind,</i> the Kentucky farm of <i>Uncle Tom&#x2019;s Cabin</i> and the dusty, sultry southern streets of <i>To Kill a Mockingbird, </i>where justice was as embattled a notion as it would soon be in Tehran. Later, these were joined by Faulkner&#x2019;s Mississippi, Fitzgerald&#x2019;s St. Paul, Edith Wharton&#x2019;s New York and then Richard Wright&#x2019;s and Ralph Ellison&#x2019;s very different New York, Raymond Chandler&#x2019;s Los Angeles and the southern towns of Flannery O&#x2019;Connor, Eudora Welty and Carson McCullers. Even now I feel there are so many geographical and fictional terrains left to discover. Perhaps this was the main reason why I could not agree with Ramin: America, to my mind, cannot be separated from its fiction.</p><p>When they were young my parents were not wealthy, but all through their lives the one thing they never hesitated to give my brother and me was books. They would entrust friends who traveled abroad with long lists of titles they couldn&#x2019;t find for us in Tehran. As I grew up and wanted the things my friends had, my father would tell me time and again in different ways that I should not focus on things. Possessions, he would say, can&#x2019;t be relied on&#x2014;they&#x2019;re easier to lose than to obtain. You should value what you can carry with you until the day you die. </p><p>One of the first books my father brought home for me to read in English was <i>Tom and Jerry</i>. I still remember when he gave me <i>The Little Prince</i> and <i>Charlotte&#x2019;s Web,</i> which taught me that something as fragile and forgettable as a spider&#x2019;s web could offer up a hidden universe. When I first read <i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,</i> I was intrigued by Tom&#x2019;s seductive charm but did not really like him&#x2014;maybe his bag was too full of tricks. In time, books and the world of the imagination they unlocked would become the portable possessions my father had hoped I would always carry with me.</p><p>Every Thursday evening, he would take me to a movie house in the fun part of town and I looked forward to our private time together all week. I remember walking hand in hand with him down Naderi Avenue, itself like a scene in an impressionist movie, with its chaotic shops selling nuts, spices, coffee, pirashki and ice cream. Alongside Iranian films, we saw ones starring Ismail Yasin, Fernandel, Norman Wisdom and Vittorio De Sica and the romantic dramas of the Indian superstars Raj Kapoor and Nargis. And, of course, we saw American films: <i>Spartacus</i> and <i>Ivanhoe, Mogambo,</i> Laurel and Hardy, <i>South Pacific </i>and one of my favorites, Danny Kaye&#x2019;s <i>Hans Christian Andersen</i>. I was not sure what to make of American musicals, where characters suddenly started gyrating in the middle of a meal or while walking down the street, as if overtaken by a mischievous genie, bursting into song only to calm down the next minute and resume eating or talking or kissing. Ever since, I have thought of America as a land of song and dance. From an early age I nurtured an idea of America that I believed in even if I knew that its reality, like any reality, was certain to fall short in some way and disappoint.</p><p>My father translated the tales of La Fontaine for my brother and me, doing all of the drawings himself, and wrote simplified versions of the classic Persian poets Ferdowsi and Nezami. More than anything when I think of him, this is what I remember: his sharing of his time and pleasure with me, as if I were his equal, his companion and co-consipirator. There was no moral lesson to be drawn; it was an act of love, but also of respect and trust.</p><p>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�</p><p>Eleven years have now passed since I met Ramin at that bookstore in Seattle, and since then I have traveled thousands of miles over thirty-two states, conversing mainly about the subject he and I talked about that day. And he did have a point. Between my first book tour, in 2003, and the next one, in 2009, many of the places I visited had undergone a significant transformation or vanished: Cody&#x2019;s in Berkeley, seven branch libraries in Philadelphia, twelve of the fourteen bookstores in Harvard Square, Harry W. Schwartz in Milwaukee and, in my own hometown of Washington, D.C., Olsson&#x2019;s and Chapters. At first it was the independent bookstores, then came the bigger chains: Borders (I wrote <i>Reading Lolita in Tehran</i> at the Borders on Eighteenth and L, now a Nordstrom Rack) and, more recently, the Barnes &amp; Noble in Georgetown, replaced by a cavernous Nike store&#x2014;and the list goes on. </p><p>It is not just bookstores and libraries that are disappearing but museums, theaters, performing arts centers, art and music schools&#x2014;all those places where I felt at home have joined the list of endangered species. <i>The San Francisco Chronicle,</i> the<i> Los Angeles Times,</i> the <i>Boston Globe</i> and my own hometown paper, <i>The Washington Post,</i> have all closed their weekend book review sections, leaving books orphaned and stranded, poor cousins to television and the movies. In a sign of the times, the Bloomberg News website recently transferred its book coverage to the Luxury section, alongside yachts, sports clubs and wine, as if to signal that books are an idle indulgence of the super-rich. But if there is one thing that should not be denied to anyone rich or poor it is the opportunity to dream. </p><p>Long before that extremely cold, sunny morning in December 2008 when I took a loyalty oath at an Immigration Services office in Fairfax, Virginia, and finally became an American citizen, I had often asked myself, What transforms a country from a place you simply live in or use as a refuge into a home? At what point do &#x201c;they&#x201d; become &#x201c;us?&#x201d; When you choose to call a place home, you no longer treat it with the episodic curiosity of a guest or a visitor. You are concerned with the good and the bad. Its shortcomings are no longer merely topics of conversation. You wonder, Why are things this way and not another? You want to improve the place, to change it, to make your complaints known. And I had done enough complaining by then to know it was time I became an American citizen.</p><p>When the founding fathers conceived of this new nation, they understood that the education of its citizens would be essential to the health of their democratic enterprise. Knowledge was not just a luxury; it was essential. In those days, men who worked for a living were not thought to be fit for public life and a liberal arts education was essential for anyone aspiring to join the political class of the new republic. Over time, politics became a more contentious enterprise, and a new political class was born that had little time for cultivated gentleman farmers who read Cicero and Tacitus for pleasure. Of course, the founding fathers&#x2019; hope was that one day all Americans, regardless of their wealth or station, would have an opportunity to read Tacitus and Cicero. The point of their new democracy was not just to vote but to make accessible to most citizens what had until then been enjoyed by only a few. Museums, libraries and schools were built to further this democratic ideal. Jefferson, who spent his life collecting books, many of which he donated to the Library of Congress, boasted that America was the ...</p></p><h2>Angels Watching over Me (Shenandoah Sisters #1)</h2><p>Book 1 of SHENANDOAH SISTERS.

The sun had beamed into Katie&#x2019;s window on countless mornings just like it. Yet this would not be like any of those other days. </p><p>Katie would look back on this as the day when, for her, everything began to change. </p><p>Greens Crossing was not a large town. A handful of stores, a livery stable, a school, a church, a bank, a general store and post office, and one saloon clustered together at the intersection of two roads. We lived a little closer to town than she did, but I&#x2019;d never set foot in it in my life. </p><p>Though the Clairbornes&#x2019; Rosewood was not the largest plantation of the region, they were known by most of the citizens of Greens Crossing. Richard Clairborne, Katie&#x2019;s father, was a hard worker, fair to his slaves, faithful to his family, but a man who kept mostly to himself. He didn&#x2019;t have close friends in town. His three sons were like him in that way. Neither they nor Katie attended the Greens Crossing school. The Clairbornes weren&#x2019;t seen at church except for occasional special circumstances. Six miles is a fair piece by horse and buggy. </p><p>Once or twice a year, Mrs. Clairborne rode the even more daunting nineteen miles into Charlotte. That&#x2019;s where she bought her own clothes and Katie&#x2019;s and did most of the family&#x2019;s shopping. But Katie had grown two inches over the winter, and the dressmaker in Greens Crossing was as skilled as any in the city. Since it would not be until later in the summer that she and her husband would be taking a wagon into Charlotte again, the buggy would carry them into Greens Crossing today. </p><p>Katie and her mother left the dressmaker&#x2019;s an hour after arriving in town and stepped from the wooden sidewalk to cross the dirt street. </p><p>"Hello, Rosalind," a woman&#x2019;s voice called out behind them. </p><p>Mrs. Clairborne paused and turned toward the general store owner&#x2019;s wife, who had spoken to her. Katie continued into the street, still thinking of the soft, pretty fabric they had picked out and the bright yellow hat they had ordered to go with the new dress. She didn&#x2019;t notice her mother stopping to chat with Mrs. Hammond. Neither did she see two riders suddenly gallop recklessly around the saloon at the corner. </p><p>A tumult of shouts and whinnies suddenly filled the air. </p><p>"Get outta the way, you&#x2014;!" </p><p>Mrs. Clairborne swiftly turned toward the ruckus. </p><p>"Katie ... watch out!" she cried as she ran frantically toward the street. </p><p>Suddenly a man&#x2019;s heavy step ran past Mrs. Clairborne. The next instant Katie was thrown to the ground. A second later the riders thundered by. </p><p>The tall, lanky Negro picked himself up off the ground beside the frightened girl. He stooped down, took her hand, and pulled Katie to her feet. </p><p>"Yo needs be a mite mo careful crossin&#x2019; da street, Miss Kat&#x2019;leen," he said, brushing the dirt from his trousers and shirt. "Dem two soldiers mighta run right ober da top er you." </p><p>Mrs. Clairborne rushed toward them. </p><p>"Oh, Henry, I can&#x2019;t thank you enough!" she exclaimed to the black man who worked in the livery stable. "Katie, are you all right?" she said, taking Katie&#x2019;s hand. Still too stunned to speak, Katie nodded. </p><p>"Dern blamed soldiers," muttered Henry, who had bought his own freedom some years before, "dey been raisin&#x2019; a ruckus roun&#x2019; &#x2019;bout fo days now. Ah doan know what&#x2019;s goin&#x2019; on. De&#x2019;re all ridin&#x2019; down t&#x2019; Charleston.

Yor husband joinin&#x2019;, ma&#x2019;am?" </p><p>"I don&#x2019;t know, Henry," sighed Mrs. Clairborne. "I really don&#x2019;t know." </p><p>As they talked, Katie gazed up into the face of the tall man. The shine in his eyes and the gleam of his perfect teeth drew her gaze into his earnest countenance. An uncommon sensation of gratitude welled up within the heart of the young white girl for the Negro man who had run in front of racing horses&#x2019; hooves to keep her from being trampled. </p><p>Mrs. Clairborne&#x2019;s voice intruded abruptly into Katie&#x2019;s reflections. </p><p>"Kathleen, sometimes I wonder if there&#x2019;s a brain in that head of yours," she said, pulling on Katie&#x2019;s hand as they walked away. "What gets into you to wander into the street like that?" </p><p>"Ah wouldn&#x2019;t be too hard on da chil&#x2019;, ma&#x2019;am," said Henry from behind them. </p><p>"I&#x2019;m grateful for what you&#x2019;ve done, Henry," rejoined Mrs. Clairborne, turning back toward the stable hand, "but now you must really mind your own business. The child is careless and scatterbrained. She needs to watch where she is going." </p><p>"Yes&#x2019;m," said the black man. He tipped his hat to mother and daughter, then ambled back in the direction of the livery.</p></p><h2>Gone: The Last Days of The New Yorker</h2><p>A fascinating and sweeping profile of a great magazine captures The New Yorker&#39;s last three decades in vivid detail and exposes the truth behind such literary luminaries as Brendan Gill, Calvin Trillin, Hannah Arendt, and Tina Brown, among others.</p><p>Renata Adler's fulminating, fascinating defense and prosecution of her longtime employer <i>The New Yorker</i> may not be the best book ever written on the subject. Brendan Gill's <i>Here at the New Yorker</i> remains the classic, and Nancy Franklin's profile of Katharine White in <i>Life Stories</i> is more graceful and insightful. But <i>Gone</i> is without doubt the hottest (as ex-editor Tina Brown might say) chronicle of the magazine's history: a scathing portrait of a world with the mad logic of Alice's Wonderland and intrigues as viciously intricate as anything in le Carr�.<p> Adler's narrative zooms like a speedboat through decade after decade of controversy. Still, <i>Gone</i> is essentially a heart-shredding account of the fall of a dynasty--that of longtime editor William Shawn, one of the century's crucial journalistic geniuses. "Mr. Shawn was the father," recalls Adler, "Lillian Ross, the mother. The son was Jonathan Schell; the spirit was J.D. Salinger. This family, it seemed to me, was ferociously judgmental." Yet nobody is more ferocious than the author herself, who was taken into the bosom of this family and stomps all its members to smithereens. </p><p> According to Adler, she was one of the lucky few invited into the circle of Mr. Shawn's biological clan, not to mention the parallel world of his mistress and "office wife" Lillian Ross. The author is quick to take Ross to task for her own trash-talking memoir of Shawn. Yet Adler is hardly a whit less destructive in <i>Gone</i>, although she wields the shiv with far greater literary skill. Indeed, those who still worship at the late editor's shrine will be shocked at her portrait of Shawn as a cruel despot who nurtured and destroyed talent according to meticulously articulated, infinitely arbitrary, altogether lunatic rules adjudicated by himself alone. Apparently he had three main responses to criticism: silence, lies, and high-handedness cloaked as high-mindedness. Adler rages at Shawn's hypocrisy, citing his refusal to give his son Wallace Shawn a job on the basis of the magazine's "No Nepotism rule." Not only was this rule nonexistent but the editor rubbed salt in the wound by hiring Schell instead, who happened to be the younger Shawn's college roommate.</p><p> Adler notes that the writers who bullied the conflict-averse Shawn tended to prosper, while those who revered him withered away, unpublished. Amazingly, she blames literature's loss of Salinger on Shawn: the ever-elusive author of <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i> "said that the reason he chose not to publish the material he had been working on was to spare Mr. Shawn the burden of having to read, and to decide whether to publish, Salinger writing about sex." Space, alas, prevents full comment on all of Adler's red-hot disclosures. Suffice it to say, however, that like a certain Truman Capote piece she insists on trashing, Adler's memoir of her office family is written in cold blood indeed. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p><b>Renata Adler</b> has had an unrivaled career as a reporter, novelist, and short story writer; intellectual gadfly; and <i>New Yorker</i> staffer.

A black woman recalls the anguish of her childhood in Arkansas and her adolescence in northern slums.</p><p>In this first of five volumes of autobiography, poet Maya Angelou recounts a youth filled with disappointment, frustration, tragedy, and finally hard-won independence. Sent at a young age to live with her grandmother in Arkansas, Angelou learned a great deal from this exceptional woman and the tightly knit black community there. These very lessons carried her throughout the hardships she endured later in life, including a tragic occurrence while visiting her mother in St. Louis and her formative years spent in California--where an unwanted pregnancy changed her life forever. Marvelously told, with Angelou&#39;s &#34;gift for language and observation,&#34; this &#34;remarkable autobiography by an equally remarkable black woman from Arkansas captures, indelibly, a world of which most Americans are shamefully ignorant.&#34;"This testimony from a black sister marks the beginning of a new era in the minds and hearts of all black men and women... <i>I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings</i>, liberates the reader into life simply because Maya Angelou confronts her own life with such a moving wonder, such a luminous dignity. I have no words for this achievement, but I know that not since the days of my childhood, when the people in books were more real than the people one saw every day, have I found myself so moved... Her portrait is a biblical study in life in the midst of death." -- James Baldwin <p>"Simultaneously touching and comic" -- <i>The New York Times</i></p><p>"It is a heroic and beautiful book." -- <i>Clevland Plain Dealer</i></p><p>"Maya Angelou is a natural writer with an inordinate sense of life and she has written and exceptional autobiographical narrative... a beautiful book -- an unconditionally involving memoir for our time or any time." -- <i>The Kirkus Reviews</i></p></p><h2>The Situation and the Story: The Art of Personal Narrative</h2><p><b>A guide to the art of personal writing, by the author of<i> Fierce Attachments </i>and <i>The End of the Novel of Love</i></b><br><br>All narrative writing must pull from the raw material of life a tale that will shape experience, transform event, deliver a bit of wisdom. In a story or a novel the "I" who tells this tale can be, and often is, an unreliable narrator but in nonfiction the reader must always be persuaded that the narrator is speaking truth.<br><br>How does one pull from one's own boring, agitated self the truth-speaker who will tell the story a personal narrative needs to tell? That is the question <i>The Situation and the Story</i> asks--and answers. Taking us on a reading tour of some of the best memoirs and essays of the past hundred years, Gornick traces the changing idea of self that has dominated the century, and demonstrates the enduring truth-speaker to be found in the work of writers as diverse as Edmund Gosse, Joan Didion, Oscar Wilde, James Baldwin, or Marguerite Duras.<br><br>This book, which grew out of fifteen years teaching in MFA programs, is itself a model of the lucid inteligence that has made Gornick one of our most admired writers of ninfiction.

If Virginia Woolf didn't have difficulty attaching herself to life, she would not have written "The Death of the Moth." If James Baldwin wasn't in perpetual violent struggle to bring the black and the white inside himself under control, there would be no "Notes of a Native Son." These pieces are the work of writers engaged at the deepest level with the essay. The form itself has released them into purposeful innerliness. Here the writing does not wander about on the page accumulating description for its own sake, or developing images independent of thought, or musing lyrically. The point of view originates in the nervous system and concentratesitself in the person of a narrator who causes the essay to move steadily forward, driven by an internal impetus that the reader can spot on page one: the obligation is to use the narrating self only to shape those associations that will provide drive and lead on to inner resolution. These writers might not "know" themselves--that is, have no more self-knowledge than the rest of us--but in each case--and this is crucial--they know who they are <i>at the moment of writing.</i> They know they are there to clarify in relation to the subject in hand--and on this obligation they deliver.When writers remain ignorant of who they are at the moment of writing--that is, when they are pulled around in the essay by motives they can neither identify accurately nor struggle to resolve--the work, more often than not, will prove either false or severely limited. D. H. Lawrence's essay "Do Women Change?" is a case in point. Ostensibly a meditation on the cyclical recurrence throughout history of the modern, the piece in actuality is a denunciation of 1920s feminists. It fails, in my view, not because of its opinions but because Lawrence himself does not know what he is about. It is the writer's unknowingness that sinks the piece."They say the modern woman is a new type," he begins, on a note of sarcasm that never abates. "But is she? I expect, in fact I am sure, there have been lots of women like ours in the past ... Women are women. They only have phases. In Rome, in Syracuse, in Athens, in Thebes,more than two or three thousand years ago, there was the bob-haired, painted, perfumed Miss and Mrs. of today ... Modernity or modernism isn't something we've just invented. It's something that comes at the end of civilizations. Just as leaves in autumn are yellow, so the women at the end of every known civilization--Roman, Greek, Egyptian, etc.--have been modern ..."I saw a joke in a German paper--a modern young man and a modern young woman leaning on an hotel balcony at night, overlooking the sea. <i>He</i>: 'See the stars sinking down over the dark restless ocean!' <i>She:</i> 'Cut it out! My room number is 32!'"That is supposed to be very modern: the very modern woman. But I believe women in Capri under Tiberias said <i>'Cut it out'</i> to their Roman and Campanian lovers in just the same way. And women in Alexandria in Cleopatra's time ... They were smart, they were chic, they said ... 'Oh, cut it out, boy! ... My room number's thirty-two! Come to the point!'"But the point, when you come to it, is a very bare little place, a very meager little affair. It's extraordinary how meager the point is once you've come to it ... A lead pencil has a point, an argument may have a point, remarks may be pointed ... But where is the point to life?"Now, women used to understand this better than men ... used to know that life is ... not a question of points, but a question of flow. It's the <i>flow</i> that matters ... And only the flow."The language is strong, the feeling vivid, and the perspective coherent, but from start to finish the piece strikes a single unvarying note of blame and accusation that never advances, never diminishes. The ills and dissatisfactions of contemporary life are steadily traced to the mean, shallow willfulness of "emancipated" women, whose behavior is seen as an emanation from something profoundly "other." There is not a single moment in the piece--not a paragraph or a sentence--when the narrator sympathizes with his subject; that is, when he sees the modern woman as she might see herself, finds in himself that which would allow him to understand why she is as she is. It is this sympathy that creates a dynamic in writing, the one necessary to stimulate internal movement. In his novels Lawrence extends it to some of his most hated characters--most famously, the brutish father in <i>Sons and Lovers</i>--but in this essay we are presented steadily with the contemplation of a world in decay because of the women who remain relentlessly "other."It is interesting to compare Lawrence with Hazlitt, a writer who also could have written "Do Women Change?" But if Hazlitt had written it, he would have been implicating himself continuously throughout his own rant. Repeatedly, we'd be given the line, the sentence, the image that would reveal Hazlitt's own anxieties about women. He would let us see the fear behind the anger, and this would make all the difference. We'd realize the writer is struggling to make sense of feelings whose complexityhe acknowledges. The struggle alone would have made the subject vital.In Hazlitt the head may be filled with blood, but the writing won't be. Neurotic as Hazlitt is, when he is writing his essays he owns his anger, and therefore he owns the material. Lawrence, on the other hand, is here possessed by his rage: it fills his head <i>and</i> his writing with blood; a thing that does not happen in his novels, where the engagement with women is equally visceral and equally antagonistic, yet is so imaginatively entered into that he cannot help but make the situation, and everyone in it, humanly understandable. In <i>Women in Love</i> and <i>Lady Chatterley's Lover</i> there are repeated rants about modern women--the ones who want to be men, the strong-willed ones, the ones who deny the primacy of the blood--but these rants do not dominate the work; they are in fact necessary for Lawrence to travel deeper into his subject: the struggle of men and women together. In the end, his characters share the situation, and we feel its power all the more because everyone is enmeshed. Fiction is the genre that lets Lawrence expand within himself: the proof that he is a born novelist but only on occasion an essayist. Here, in "Do Women Change?" he cannot manage it. Women remain an undynamic "them." It's the absence of dynamism that keeps the essay static, stifles its growth from within.There is another writer who demonstrates repeatedly--and in exactly the same way as Lawrence--that heis an inspired writer of novels but not of nonfiction. V. S. Naipaul's vision of life is fundamentally cold, devoid in some important way of human warmth. Nevertheless, in his novels the coldness is made to burn. The viewpoint remains bleak, but the work opens out like some poisonous bloom; a mysterious empathy is in operation; the situation compels and the characters tell a story. In the nonfiction, however, the absence of sympathy is startling--and fatal. A perfect example of this striking differential is to be found in reading Naipaul's novel <i>Guerrillas</i> together with his essay "The Killings in Trinidad." Both are derived from the same newspaper story about a madman who became a self-styled black radical leader and ended up performing ritual murder on a number of his followers, including an upper-class Englishwoman who'd fallen under his spell. The novel is mysteriously injected with a power of dread that is so penetrating it endows the work with visionary properties: the situation becomes metaphoric. In the essay the principals--all of them, victims and victimizer alike--are presented like bugs under glass: shrunken, pinned, diminished. Naipaul's skin crawls with an untransformed disgust for his own subject. Disgust makes him shrink back. The shrinking attenuates the performance. In the end, the reader registers only the nastiness of the writer's feelings. He is standing too far back to achieve the right distance: the one necessary for engagement.In all imaginative writing sympathy for the subject isnecessary not because it is the politically correct or morally decent posture to adopt but because an absence of sympathy shuts down the mind: engagement fails, the flow of association dries up, and the work narrows. What I mean by sympathy is simply that level of empathic understanding that endows the subject with dimension. The empathy that allows us, the readers, to see the "other" as the other might see him or herself is the empathy that provides movement in the writing. When someone writes a <i>Mommie Dearest</i> memoir--where the narrator is presented as an innocent and the subject as a monster--the work fails because the situation remains static. For the drama to deepen, we must see the loneliness of the monster and the cunning of the innocent. Above all, it is the narrator who must complicate in order that the subject be given life.In fiction, a cast of characters is put to work that will cover all the bases: some will speak the author's inclination, some the opposition--that is, some represent an idea of self, some the agonistic other; allow them all their say, and the writer moves into a dynamic. In nonfiction, the writer has only the singular self to work with. So it is the other in oneself that the writer must seek and find to create movement, achieve a dynamic. Inevitably, the piece builds only when the narrator is involved not in confession but in this kind of self-investigation, the kind that means to provide motion, purpose, and dramatic tension. Here, it is self-implication that is required. To see one'sown part in the situation--that is, one's own frightened or cowardly or self-deceived part--is to create the dynamic.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;...</p><h2>Cross-Stitch Patterns in Color (English and Danish Edition)</h2><p>Landscapes, flowers, and plants are some of the design themes that may be reproduced</p><p>Text: English, Danish (translation)</p><h2>Somebody Else Is on the Moon</h2><p>Few people noticed the secret codewords used by our astronauts to describe the moon.

Bobby Jones, an amateur golfer who had already won nine of the seventeen major championships he'd entered during the last seven years, mounted his final campaign against the record books. In four months, he conquered the British Amateur Championship, the British Open, the United States Open, and finally the United States Amateur Championship, an achievement so extraordinary that writers dubbed it the Grand Slam.</p><p>A natural, self-taught player, Jones made his debut at the U.S. Amateur Championship at the age of 14. But for the next seven years, Jones struggled in major championships, and not until he turned 21 in 1923 would he harness his immense talent.</p><p>What the world didn't know was that throughout his playing career the intensely private Jones had longed to retreat from fame's glaring spotlight. While the press referred to him as "a golfing machine," the strain of competition exacted a ferocious toll on his physical and emotional well-being. During the season of the Slam he constantly battled exhaustion, nearly lost his life twice, and came perilously close to a total collapse. By the time he completed his unprecedented feat, Bobby Jones was the most famous man not only in golf, but in the history of American sports. Jones followed his crowning achievement with a shocking announcement: his retirement from the game at the age of 28. His abrupt disappearance from the public eye into a closely guarded private life helped create a mythological image of this hero from the Golden Age of sports that endures to this day.</p></p><p><strong>Mark Frost</strong> is the author of the critically acclaimed <em>The Greatest Game Ever Played</em>, <em>The Grand Slam</em>, and the bestselling <em>The List of 7</em>, <em>The 6 Messiahs</em>, and <em>Before I Wake</em>. He received a Writer's Guild Award and an Emmy nomination for his work as executive story editor on the acclaimed television series <em>Hill Street Blues</em>, and was the co-creator and executive producer of the ABC television series <em>Twin Peaks</em>. He lives in Los Angeles and upstate New York.Before Arnold, Jack and Tiger, there was Bobby. After winning the Grand Slam of golf in 1930, Jones stood like a colossus over the American sporting scene. He is the only individual to have been recognized with two ticker tape parades down Broadway's Canyon of Heroes. Frost (<i>The Greatest Game Ever Played</i>) has written a swift, surefooted account of Jones's remarkable life and career. From Jones's precocious early days on the Atlanta links to his sudden retreat from the media spotlight, Frost covers every detail. The self-taught Jones began playing serious tournaments at 14 and quickly moved into the ranks of the world's best players. In 1930, he won the four major tournaments of the time: the British Amateur, the British Open, the U.S. Open and the U.S. Amateur, which sportswriters dubbed the Grand Slam. Following this success, Jones promptly retired. Later diagnosed with a rare nerve illness, he lived out his life as golf's elder statesman. While Frost's eager prose has an engaging, "you are there" quality, for nongolfers the question is whether they actually <i>do</i> want to be there. Frost strains to place Jones's achievement in the broader context of American history. As bedside reading for the literate duffer, this is a hole in one. For the average reader, it's a bogey. 15 b&amp;w photos. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

For more information, you can visit MCBeaton.com.The seventh Hamish Macbeth mystery (after Death of a Prankster ) lacks the series' key strengths: the canny, tousle-haired, beanpole charm of the Scottish highland copper and the dour weirdness of the remote village he lives in are given scant play here. Instead, the author scrambles to assemble her cast, kill her odious and obese victim and have Hamish shyly serve up the solution in the presence of the usual cast of nasty superiors who hate his guts. A motley assortment of desperate souls, members of the Checkmate Singles Club, have come to the village hotel to spouse-hunt. Suddenly, one of the visit's organizers, a hog of a woman, dies with an apple inserted in her sizable gullet. Peta Gore wasn't exactly a lovable sort, and among the gang of timid, mousy secretaries, aspiring yuppies, big-haired bimbos and elderly lawyers, a killer surely lurks. In most Macbeth mysteries, he can be found cadging drinks, walking Towser the dog and trying to come to terms with his feelings for fair Priscilla, daughter of the local fallen gentryman. This time Towser never gets out of the tiny police station, and the Hamish/Priscilla romantic misfires seem to be repeating themselves.

He is currently at work on several new novels and media projects.Chapter 1<br><br> A most peculiar thing happened to the battleship as it departed the Repler system: initially daunting in size and form, it proceeded to undergo a kind of reverse metamorphosis, as if a butterfly were turning backward into an ungainly caterpillar. Intimidating weapons blisters collapsed in upon themselves like so many glistening, harmless bubbles. Lethal wave-form projectors shrank and slivered. Vast projecting appurtenances shimmied and vanished like the ominous illusions they were, until the menacing martial shape had imploded completely. In its place gleamed the far smaller fast-moving footprint of an ordinary cargo carrier approaching changeover. Clearly not a craft that was part of the impressive fleet component still orbiting the planet that was rapidly receding behind it, nor one that was likely to attract undue notice.<br><br> Visually revamped, externally overhauled, and mechanically face-lifted determinedly downscale, the Teacher slipped unchallenged into the physically unreasonable but mathematically coherent state known colloquially as space-plus, whereupon it swiftly left the Commonwealth border system known as Repler not only far behind, but far beyond it.<br><br> &#x201c;Changeover complete. Exterior appearance modified as per necessity. Proceeding on general Almaggee vector. Awaiting instructions.&#x201d; A pause, then, &#x201c;Resume search?&#x201d;<br><br> Resume search. Flinx stared out the command port at the splay of distorted stars forward. Resume search for what? His ship was doubtless referring to the search his friends and mentors Bran Tse-Mallory and the Eint Truzenzuzex had sent him on. The one he had agreed to undertake provided only that they see to and look after his injured love Clarity Held back on New Riviera. A simple enough quest request.<br><br> All he was being asked to do was search and scour the vast reaches of the largely uninhabited section of the Sagittarius Arm of the galaxy opposite the Commonwealth, locate and establish contact with an unbelievably ancient planet-sized weapons platform of the long-extinct&#x2014;except for one recently demised individual&#x2014;war-like species called the Tar-Aiym, and persuade it to aid in defending all civilization against an immense, undefined menace steadily accelerating in this direction from a region of space near Bo�tes known as the Great Emptiness. And do this while avoiding the attentions of the increasingly persistent and curious Commonwealth authorities, the crazed suicidal adherents of the Order of Null who badly wanted him dead, certain elements of the AAnn Empire, and perhaps the isolated Qwarm assassin. All in hopes of saving the galaxy and, with luck, of in a few years making it to his thirtieth birthday. And maybe, just maybe, finding out who his father was.<br><br> He took a deep breath. From her position sprawled across the center of the command console, the minidrag Pip looked up at him, yawned, and stretched her brilliant pink-and-blue wings without unfurling them. He nodded, though not particularly at her.<br><br> Time for tea.<br><br> The Teacher brewed perfect tea. Many was the time, and more frequently lately than not, he found himself considering perfection tedious. But not when it came to the making of tea. Darjeeling tea from Terra, anar tea from Rhyinpine, unique forest teas from Alaspin; the ship was steeped in those and more. Various chemicals both natural and synthetic for calming the mind and easing the body were available to the Teacher. Except on rare occasions he disdained them all in favor of flavor in the form of natural tea.<br><br> When it was delivered to him in a pot and cup whose functions, if not the material from which they had been made, would have been recognizable to a tea drinker from a thousand years ago, he stirred in additives, leaned back, and wondered at how many ancient ship captains had similarly sat and sipped their own favored libation while studying the stars. They had done so from a considerably different perspective, of course. They had been sailing along beneath the stars, not among them.<br><br> The hot, sweetened, dark gold liquid calmed his body but did little to settle his thoughts. Behind him lay the threat of the alien Vom, extinguished. Ahead lay a search for something to help deal with an infinitely greater threat. A search that might well take years. To what end? Not for the first time he wondered why he ought to bother. What about his own personal priorities? What about the future for himself and Clarity he dared to dream of in quiet moments? If the evil he had perceived within the Great Emptiness was not due to arrive for hundreds or even thousands of years, why should he care about it? Why should he have to be the one to sacrifice his life and happiness in a probably futile attempt to forestall the inevitable?<br><br> Everything went in cycles. Perhaps the eventual arrival of the Great Evil represented nothing more than the ending of one such cycle and the beginning of another. Neither of which, as he lived out his normal life span, he need be expected to deal with.<br><br> Still running away, he told himself as he sipped. The realization burned him more than the hot liquid.<br><br> After what he&#x2019;d seen on Repler, the wild thought occurred to him that maybe he should take drugs to make himself feel better. Perhaps try something stronger than tea. Given his singular abilities, however, there was no telling, no way of predicting, what the cost of such an action might be. While he felt he could deal with any consequences that the sampling of artificial stimulants might pose to himself, there was no telling what kind of harm such an indulgence involving his increasingly unmanageable abilities might visit on those around him. He decided that such experimentation was, at least for now, not a viable option.<br><br> All right then, the voice inside himself demanded. If you&#x2019;re going to devote yourself to saving something, maybe what you need to stiffen your resolve is to prove to yourself that that something is worth saving. That it&#x2019;s worth the sacrifice. What he had recently experienced and observed while on Repler was not encouraging. Selfishness, greed, violence. Conscious misuse of intelligence. Willful consumption of sentience-altering drugs. Bloodhype. The noblest creature he had encountered during his sojourn on Repler&#x2014;the one with whom he had personally empathized the most&#x2014;had belonged not to one of the existing races whose future he was being asked to help save but to a Tar-Aiym named Peot: the last surviving representative of that long-dead, war-like species.<br><br> On the other hand, despite his recent, self-challenging, near-defiant, and very brief dalliance with the United Church officer Kitten Kai-sung, there was Clarity. Not to mention Bran Tse-Mallory, Truzenzuzex, Mother Mastiff, and other exemplary examples of contemporary cognizance and compassion. Even those who hungered first and foremost for wealth, like the old prospector Knigta Yakus, were at heart good folk whose heritable lines were deserving of preservation.<br><br> Maybe that was it, he told himself as he sat up straighter in the command chair. In the course of his short but very full life, so many of those he had been in close contact with had been in one way or another exceptional or atypical. Easy enough to rationalize risking all to save such. But what about the great, restless, surging mass of others? Did they deserve salvation? Was the future of those vast, unknown, swarming genetic masses worth the sacrifice of his personal happiness? That was really what was at stake. That was truly what he needed to decide.<br><br> He had told the now deceased Peot that he needed to acquire wisdom. Where to go and what to do to find it? In his short life he had seen much. Love, hate, all manner of planetary environments. But not, his recent encounter on Repler with the disreputable drugger and emoman Dominic Rose notwithstanding, the full wickedness and inventive iniquity of which humankind and others were capable. In order to pass judgment on his fellow sentients, and to acquire the fullness of wisdom that he sought, it was only reasonable to believe that he needed to experience that as well. Needed to proceed counter to his natural impulses and immerse himself in the worst that full-blown civilization had to offer.<br><br> He mentally and methodically worked his way through the most relevant steller schematics. The source for the kind of learning he desired lay a good way distant but not all that far off his present vector. Determination overrode a hesitancy that as recently as several years ago would have held him back from proceeding. Determination, and a seriously advanced case of what-the-hell.<br><br> Sensing his change of mood, Pip spread her wings, rose, and glided over to land on his right shoulder. As her tail end curled affectionately around his neck, he reached up with his free hand to absently stroke the smooth, scaly back of her head.<br><br> &#x201c;Course change,&#x201d; he announced aloud, lowering his cup. &#x201c;We will remain within the borders of the Commonwealth, but off the Almaggee vector. Set a course for Visaria.&#x201d;<br><br> The Teacher&#x2019;s ship-mind was programmed to emulate an extensive and varied assortment of human reactions, but pausing for emphasis was not one of them. Therefore, its skepticism was immediate.<br><br> &#x201c;Permit me to point out that Visaria represents a considerable detour from the most direct route into the Blight, the region you wish to search for signs of the absented Tar-Aiym artifact.&#x201d;<br><br> He glanced toward one of the numerous visual pickups that were scattered about the command chamber. &#x201c;Yep.&#x201d;<br><br> Nonexistent applicable programming notwithstanding, the ship-mind momentarily did...</p><h2>Creative Choice in Hypnosis (The Seminars, Workshops, and Lectures of Milton H. Erickson, Vol 4)</h2><p>From the front flap of this 274 page book: &#34;&#39;Creative Choice in Hypnosis&#39; explores the following important questions through a presentation, never before published, of Erickson&#39;s own hypnotic workshops and demonstrations: Is hypnosis a process of manipulation or facilitation; Does the hypnotherapist control people; Or, does the hypnotherapist simply give people permission to heal themselves. This authoritarian-permissive paradox of hypnotherapy is most evident in Erickson&#39;s use of the double bind. This volume takes the reader on a journey that recaptures Erickson&#39;s evolution of the therapeutic double bind: from a technique based on an authoritarian concept of &#39;illusory choice&#39;, the book takes us to a modern vision of the double bind as a &#39;free choice among comparable alternatives&#39;. This new vision represents a profound shift in attitude: creative choice, not control or manipulation, is now fostered as the inherent agent of healing in psychotherapy. [This book] also builds an important bridge between East and West by illustrating the common denominator of the naturalistic utilization approaches to hypnosis in the West and the traditional Zen methods for achieving satori, or enlightenment, in the East.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Assorted Foxtrot</h2><p>FoxTrot has built its considerable appeal with its sincere depiction of the hilarious clashes seen in everyday family life without getting too sticky sweet.

Her mother was a caricaturist who designed 165 of Finland&#39;s stamps and her father was a sculptor. She studied painting in Finland, Sweden and France, and subsequently became a book illustrator. Her extraordinary illustrative style is seen as a design classic the world over. Originally written in Swedish, the Moomintroll books have been translated into over 40 languages and adapted for television, film, radio and opera. Tove Jansson lived alone on a small island in the gulf of Finland, where most of her books were written. She died in 2001.The Spring TuneOne calm and cloudless evening, toward the end of April, Snufkin found himself far enough to the north to see still-unmelted patches of snow on the northern slopes.He had been walking all day through undisturbed landscapes, listening to the cries of the birds also on their way northward, home from the South.Walking had been easy, because his knapsack was nearly empty and he had no worries on his mind. He felt happy about the wood and the weather, and himself. Tomorrow and yesterday were both at a distance, and just at present the sun was shining brightly red between the birches, and the air was cool and soft.&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the right evening for a tune,&#x201d; Snufkin thought. A new tune, one part expectation, two parts spring sadness, and for the rest just the great delight of walking alone and liking it.He had kept this tune under his hat for several days, but hadn&#x2019;t quite dared to take it out yet. It had to grow into a kind of happy conviction. Then he would simply have to put his lips to the mouth-organ, and all the notes would jump instantly into their places.If he released them too soon, they might get stuck crossways and make only a half-good tune, or he might lose them altogether and never be in the right mood to get hold of them again. Tunes are serious things, especially if they have to be jolly and sad at the same time.But this evening Snufkin felt rather sure of his tune. It was there, waiting, nearly full-grown&#x2014;and it was going to be the best he ever made.Then, when he arrived in Moominvalley, he&#x2019;d sit on the bridge rail and play it, and Moomintroll would say at once: &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a good one. Really a good one.&#x201d;Snufkin stopped in his tracks, feeling just a little bit uneasy. Yes, Moomintroll, always waiting and longing. Moomintroll, who sat at home, who waited for him and admired him, and who always told him: &#x201c;Of course you have to feel free. Naturally you must go away. I do understand that you have to be alone at times.&#x201d;And all the while his eyes were black with disappointment and no one could help it.&#x201c;Oh, my, oh, my,&#x201d; Snufkin said to himself and continued on his way.&#x201c;Oh, my, oh, my. He&#x2019;s got such a lot of feelings, this Moomintroll. I won&#x2019;t think of him now. He&#x2019;s a splendid Moomin, but I don&#x2019;t have to think of him now. Tonight I&#x2019;m alone with my tune, and tonight isn&#x2019;t tomorrow.&#x201d;In a little while Snufkin had managed to forget all about Moomintroll. He was sniffing around for a good place to camp in, and when he heard a brook a bit farther on in the wood he went toward the sound.The last red ray of sunlight had vanished between the birches. Now came the spring twilight, slow and blue. All the wood was changed, and the white pillars of the birches went wandering farther and farther off in the blue dusk.The brook was a good one.It went rushing clear and brown over wads of last year&#x2019;s leaves, through small tunnels of leftover ice, swerving through the green moss and throwing itself headlong down in a small waterfall on to a white-sand bottom. In places it droned sharp as a mosquito, then it tried to sound great and menacing, stopped, gurgled with a mouthful of melted snow, and laughed at it all.Snufkin stood listening in the damp moss. &#x201c;I must have the brook in my tune also,&#x201d; he thought. &#x201c;In the refrain, I think.&#x201d;A small stone suddenly came loose near the waterfall and raised the pitch of the brook a whole octave.&#x201c;Not bad,&#x201d; Snufkin said admiringly. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the way to do it. A sudden change, just in passing. I&#x2019;ll have to find that brook a tune of its own.&#x201d;He took out his old saucepan and filled it from the waterfall. Then he went in under the firs to look for firewood. The ground was still wet from the spring thaw and the rains, and Snufkin had to crawl far under a brambly windfall to find any dry sticks. When he reached out, someone gave a sudden shout and flashed past him and off among the firs, still crying and squeaking all the way.&#x201c;Oh, yes,&#x201d; Snufkin said. &#x201c;Creeps and woodies everywhere. Funny how nervous they always seem to be. The smaller the jumpier.&#x201d;He found a dried stump and some sticks and built himself a good campfire by the brook. Snufkin was used to cooking his own dinner. He never cooked a dinner for other people if he could avoid it, nor did he care much for other people&#x2019;s dinners. So many people insisted on talking when they had a meal.Also they had a great liking for chairs and tables, and some of them used napkins. He even had heard of a Hemulen who changed his clothes everytime he was about to eat, but that was probably slander.A little distractedly, Snufkin ate his meager soup while he rested his eyes on the green moss by the birches.The tune was quite near at hand, easy to catch by the tail. But there was time enough to wait: it was hedged in and couldn&#x2019;t get away. No, better to wash the dishes first, then light a pipe&#x2014;and afterwards, when the campfire was burning down and the night creatures started calling for each other, then he&#x2019;d have it.Snufkin was washing his saucepan in the brook when he caught sight of the Creep. It was sitting on the far side below a tree root, looking at him. Its eyes were scared but very interested, following Snufkin&#x2019;s every movement.Two shy eyes under a mop of hair. Just the look people have who are never noticed.Snufkin pretended that he hadn&#x2019;t seen the Creep. He raked up his fire and cut himself some fir twigs to sit on. He took out his pipe and lit it. He puffed a few clouds of smoke toward the night sky and waited for the spring tune.It didn&#x2019;t come. Instead he felt the Creep&#x2019;s eyes upon him. They watched everything he did, admiringly, and he began to feel uneasy once more. He clapped his paws together and shouted: &#x201c;Shoo! Be off!&#x201d;At this the Creep slunk out from under the tree root&#x2014;it was still on the other side of the brook&#x2014;and said, very shyly: &#x201c;I hope I haven&#x2019;t scared you? I know who you are. You&#x2019;re Snufkin.&#x201d;And then the Creep stepped straight into the water and started to wade across. The brook was rather too broad for it, and the water was ice-cold. A couple of times the Creep lost its foothold and tumbled over, but Snufkin was feeling so uneasy that he simply didn&#x2019;t think of giving it a hand.Finally a rather thin and miserable Creep crawled ashore and said with chattering teeth: &#x201c;Hello, I&#x2019;m so happy to meet you.&#x201d;&#x201c;Hello,&#x201d; Snufkin answered equally coldly.&#x201c;May I warm myself by your fire?&#x201d; the Creep continued, its wet little face shining with happiness. &#x201c;Just think of it, then I&#x2019;ll be the Creep who has sat by Snufkin&#x2019;s campfire. I&#x2019;ll never forget that.&#x201d;The Creep edged closer, laid one paw on Snufkin&#x2019;s knapsack, and solemnly whispered: &#x201c;Is this where you keep the mouth-organ? Do you have it here?&#x201d;&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Snufkin said, rather crossly. His tune was lost, loneliness was gone, all was different. He clenched his teeth around the pipe-stem and stared in among the birches without really seeing them.&#x201c;Now, don&#x2019;t mind me,&#x201d; the Creep said innocently. &#x201c;In case you&#x2019;d like to play, I mean. You&#x2019;d never guess how I long for a little music. I&#x2019;ve never heard any. But I&#x2019;ve heard about you. The hedgehog, and Toffle, and my mother, they&#x2019;ve all told me ... Toffle has even seen you, once! Yes, you can&#x2019;t imagine ... Nothing much ever happens here ... But we dream lots and lots ...&#x201d;&#x201c;Well, what&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d; Snufkin asked. The evening was spoiled anyway, so he thought it easier to talk.&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so small that I haven&#x2019;t got a name,&#x201d; the Creep said eagerly. &#x201c;As a matter of fact, nobody&#x2019;s even asked me about it before. And then I meet you, whom I&#x2019;ve heard so much about and always longed to see, and the first thing you ask me is what my name is! Do you think ... perhaps you might ... I mean, would it be a lot of trouble for you to think up a name for me, a name that would be only mine and no one else could have it? Now, tonight?&#x201d;Snufkin mumbled something and pulled his hat over his eyes. Someone flew across the brook on long pointed wings and gave a long, sad cry among the trees: Yo-yooo, yo-ooo, tee-woo ...&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t ever be really free if you admire somebody too much,&#x201d; Snufkin suddenly said. &#x201c;I know.&#x201d;&#x201c;I know you know everything,&#x201d; the Little Creep prattled on, edging closer still. &#x201c;I know you&#x2019;ve seen everything. You&#x2019;re right in everything you say, and I&#x2019;ll always try to become as free as you are ... So now you&#x2019;re on your way to Moominvalley to have a rest and meet your friends ... The hedgehog told me that Moomintroll starts waiting for you as soon as he wakes from winter sleep ... Isn&#x2019;t it a nice thing to know that someone&#x2019;s longing for you and waiting and waiting to see you again?&#x201d;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m coming when it suits me!&#x201d; Snufkin cried violently. &#x201c;Perhaps I shan&#x2019;t come at all. Perhaps I will go somewhere else.&#x201d;&#x201c;Oh. Then he&#x2019;ll be sad,&#x201d; said the Creep.Its fur was beginning to dry and becoming light brown and soft. It picked at the knapsack once again and asked cautiously: &#x201c;Would you perhaps ... you who have traveled so much ... ?&#x201d;&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Snufkin said. And he thought angrily: &#x201c;Why can&#x2019;t they ever let my wanderings alone! Can&#x2019;t they understand that I&#x2019;ll talk it all to pieces if I have to tell about it. Then it&#x2019;s gone, and when I try to remember what it really was like, I remember only my own story.&#x201d;There was a long silence, and the night bird cried again.The Creep rose and said in a small voice: &#x201c;Well, I must be off, I think. Cheerio.&#x201d;&#x201c;Cheerio,&#x201d; Snufkin said, fidgeting a little. &#x201c;Listen. Er. That name you asked for. What about Teety-woo, for instance. Teety-woo, don&#x2019;t you see, a light beginning, sort of, and a little sadness to round it off.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Little Creep stared at him with yellow eyes in the firelight. It thought its name over, tasted it, listened to it, crawled inside it, and finally turned its nose to the sky and softly howled its new name, so sadly and ecstatically that Snufkin felt a shiver along his back.Then a brown tail disappeared in the brambles, and all was silent.&#x201c;Golly,&#x201d; Snufkin said and kicked at an ember. He rapped out his pipe. Then he rose and shouted: &#x201c;Hello! Come back.&#x201d;But the wood was silent. &#x201c;Oh, well,&#x201d; Snufkin thought. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t always be friendly. It&#x2019;s impossible; there isn&#x2019;t the time. And at least this Creep has got a name.&#x201d;He sat down again and listened to the brook and the silence, and waited for his tune to come back. But it didn&#x2019;t come. He knew at once that it had moved too far away to be caught. Perhaps he&#x2019;d never catch it. The only thing he seemed to hear was the eager and shy voice of the Creep, talking and talking and talking.&nbsp;Excerpted from Tales from Moominvalley by Tove Jansson.<br>Copyright � 1962 by Tove Jansson.<br>Published in 2010 by Farrar Straus Giroux.<br>All rights reserved.

Along with &#34;The Knights of Bushido: A Short History of Japanese War Crimes&#34; (1853674990) by the same author, it was a phenomenal best-seller when first published. Drawing on documentary evidence submitted to the Nuremberg trials and brilliantly written by an expert intimately connected to the prosecution of war criminals, this searing condemnation of the Third Reich&#39;s crimes is factual, objective, and unstinting in its efforts to expose the truth behind real or alleged atrocities. It examines Hitler&#39;s instruments of tyranny--SS, Gestapo, and Army--and repression, German crimes against prisoners of war, outrages committed on the high seas, crimes against civilian populations, the mass use of slave labor, the concentration camps; and the &#34;Final Solution&#34; of the Jewish question.</p><p></p><h2>Passages: Predictable Crises fo Adult Life</h2><p>&#39;A lifetime of happiness!

Her mother arranged with the State Library to have books sent to Yamhill and acted as librarian in a lodge room upstairs over a bank. There Mrs. Cleary learned to love books. When the family moved to Portland, where Mrs. Cleary attended grammar school and high school, she soon found herself in the low reading circle, an experience that has given her sympathy for the problems of struggling readers. By the third grade she had conquered reading and spent much of her childhood either with books or on her way to and from the public library. Before long her school librarian was suggesting that she should write for boys and girls when she grew up. The idea appealed to her, and she decided that someday she would write the books she longed to read but was unable to find on the library shelves, funny stories about her neighborhood and the sort of children she knew. <p>After graduation from junior college in Ontario, California, and the University of California at Berkeley, Mrs. Cleary entered the School of Librarianship at the University of Washington, Seattle. There she specialized in library work with children. She was Children's Librarian in Yakima, Washington, until she married Clarence Cleary and moved to California. The Clearys are the parents of twins, now grown. Mrs. Cleary's hobbies are travel and needlework. </p><p>Mrs. Cleary's books have earned her many prestigious awards, including the 1984 John Newbery Medal for Dear Mr. Henshaw, for the most distinguished contribution to American literature for children in 1983. Her Ramona and Her Father and Ramona Quimby, Age 8 were named 1978 and 1982 Newbery Honor Books, respectively. Among Mrs. Cleary's other awards are the American Library Association's 1975 Laura Ingalls Wilder Award, the Catholic Library Association's 1980 Regina Medal, and the University of Southern Mississippi's 1982 Silver Medallion, all presented in recognition of her lasting contribution to children's literature. In addition, Mrs. Cleary was the 1984 United States author nominee for the Hans Christian Andersen Award, a prestigious international award. Equally important are the more than 35 statewide awards Mrs. Cleary's books have received based on the direct votes of her young readers. The Beverly Cleary Sculpture Garden for Children, featuring bronze statues of Ramona Quimby, Henry Huggins, and Ribsy, was recently opened in Portland, Oregon. </p><p>This witty and warm author is truly an international favorite. Mrs. Cleary's books appear in over twenty countries in fourteen languages and her characters, including Henry Huggins, Ellen Tebbits, Otis Spoffordm, and Beezus and Ramona Quimby, as well as Ribsy, Socks, and Ralph S. Mouse, have delighted children for generations. There have been Japanese, Spanish, and Swedish television programs based on the Henry Huggins series. PBS-TV aired a ten-part series based on the Ramona stories. One-hour adaptations of the three Ralph S. Mouse books have been shown on ABC-TV. All of Mrs. Cleary's adaptations still can be seen on cable television, and the Ramona adaptations are available in video stores.</p><p></p></p><h2>The Unreasoning Mask</h2><p>Ramstan, captain of the al-Buraq, a rare model spaceship capable of instantaneous travel between two points, attempts to stop an unidentified &#34;creature&#34; that is annihilating intelligent life on planets throughout the universe</p><p>Philip Jos� Farmer, a science fiction author for thirty years, is considered one of the most daring, innovative and far-thinking writers in the genre.

The city was slowing down. Soon the cold would hit hard, and, like an animal, Portland had stored its fat for the long months ahead. There were tourist dollars in the bank; enough, it was hoped, to tide everyone over until Memorial Day. The streets were quieter than they once were. The locals, who coexisted sometimes uneasily with the leaf peepers and outlet shoppers, now had their home almost to themselves once more. They claimed their regular tables in diners and coffee shops, in restaurants and bars. There was time to pass idle conversation with waitresses and chefs, the professionals no longer run ragged by the demands of customers whose names they did not know. At this time of year, it was possible to feel the true rhythm of the small city, the slow beating of its heart untroubled by the false stimulus of those who came from away.</p><p>I was sitting at a corner table in the Porthole, eating bacon and fried potatoes and not watching Kathleen Kennedy and Stephen Frazier talking about the secretary of state's surprise visit to Iraq. There was no sound from the TV, which made ignoring it a whole lot easier. A stove fire burned next to the window overlooking the water, the masts of the fishing boats bobbed and swayed in the morning breeze, and a handful of people occupied the other tables, just enough to create the kind of welcoming ambience that a breakfast venue required, for such things rely on a subtle balance.</p><p>The Porthole still looked like it did when I was growing up, perhaps even as it had since it first opened in 1929. There were green-marbled linoleum tiles on the floor, cracked here and there but spotlessly clean. A long, wooden counter, topped with copper, stretched almost the entire length of the room, its black-cushioned metal stools anchored to the floor, the counter dotted with glasses, condiments, and two glass plates of freshly baked muffins. The walls were painted light green, and if you stood up, you could peer into the kitchen through the twin serving hatches divided by a painted "Scallops" sign. A chalkboard announced the day's specials, and there were five beer taps serving Guinness, a few Allagash and Shipyard ales, and, for those who didn't know any better, or who did and just didn't give a rat's ass, Coors Light. There were buoys hanging from the walls, which in any other dining establishment in the Old Port might have come across as kitsch but here were simply a reflection of the fact that this was a place frequented by locals who fished. One wall was almost entirely glass, so even on the dullest of mornings the Porthole appeared to be flooded with light.</p><p>In the Porthole you were always aware of the comforting buzz of conversation, but you could never quite hear all of what anyone nearby was saying, not clearly. This morning about twenty people were eating, drinking, and easing themselves into the day the way Mainers will do. Five workers from the Harbor Fish Market sat in a row at the bar, all dressed identically in blue jeans, hooded tops, and baseball caps, laughing and stretching in the warmth, their faces bitten red by the elements. Beside me, four businessmen had cell phones and notepads interspersed with their white coffee mugs, making out as if they were working but, from the occasional snatches that drifted over to me and could be understood, seemingly more interested in singing the praises of Pirates coach Kevin Dineen. Across from them, two women, a mother and daughter, were having one of those discussions that required a lot of hand gestures and shocked expressions. They looked as if they were having a ball.</p><p>I liked the Porthole. The tourists don't come here much, certainly not in winter, and even in summer they hadn't tended to disturb the balance much until someone strung a banner over Wharf Street advertising the fact that there was more to this seemingly unpromising stretch of waterfront than met the eye: Boone's Seafood Restaurant, the Harbor Fish Market, the Comedy Connection, and the Porthole itself. Even that hadn't exactly led to an onslaught. Banner or no banner, the Porthole didn't scream the fact of its existence, and a battered soda sign and a fluttering flag were the only actual indication of its presence visible from the main drag of Commercial. In a sense, you kind of needed to know that it was there to see it in the first place, especially on dark winter mornings, and any lingering tourists walking along Commercial at the start of a bitter Maine winter's day needed to have a pretty good idea of where they were headed if they were going to make it to spring with their health intact. Faced with a bracing nor'easter, few had the time or the inclination to explore the hidden corners of the city.</p><p>Still, off-season travelers sometimes made their way past the fish market and the comedy club, their feet echoing solidly on the old wood of the boardwalk that bordered the wharf to the left, and found themselves at the Porthole's door, and it was a good bet that the next time they came to Portland, they would head straight for the Porthole again, but maybe they wouldn't tell too many of their friends about it because it was the kind of place that you liked to keep to yourself. There was a deck outside overlooking the water, where people could sit and eat in summer, but in winter they removed the tables and left the deck empty. I think I liked it better in winter. I could take a cup of coffee in hand and head out, safe in the knowledge that most folks preferred to drink their coffee inside where it was warm, and that I wasn't likely to be disturbed by anyone. I would smell the salt, and feel the sea breeze on my skin, and if the wind and the weather were right, the scent would remain with me for the rest of the morning. Mostly, I liked that scent. Sometimes, if I was feeling bad, I didn't care so much for it, because the taste of the salt on my lips reminded me of tears, as if I had recently tried to kiss away another's pain. When that happened, I thought of Rachel, and of Sam, my daughter. Often, too, I thought of the wife and daughter who had gone before them.</p><p>Days like that were silent days.</p><p>But today I was inside, and I was wearing a jacket and tie. The tie was a deep red Hugo Boss, the jacket Armani, yet nobody in Maine ever paid much attention to labels. Everyone figured that if you were wearing it, then you'd bought it at a discount, and if you hadn't and had paid ticket instead, then you were an idiot.</p><p>I hadn't paid ticket.</p><p>The front door opened, and a woman entered. She was wearing a black pantsuit and a coat that had probably cost her a lot when she bought it but was now showing its age. Her hair was black, but colored with something that lent it a hint of red. She looked a little surprised by her surroundings, as though, having made her way down past the battered exteriors of the wharf buildings, she had expected to be mugged by pirates. Her eyes alighted on me and her head tilted quizzically. I raised a finger, and she made her way through the tables to where I sat. I rose to meet her, and we shook hands.</p><p>"Mr. Parker?" she said.</p><p>"Ms. Clay."</p><p>"I'm sorry I'm late. There was an accident on the bridge. The traffic was backed up a ways."</p><p>Rebecca Clay had called me the day before, asking if I might be able to help her with a problem she was having. She was being stalked, and, not surprisingly, she didn't much care for it. The cops had been able to do nothing. The man, she said, seemed almost to sense their coming, because he was always gone by the time they arrived, no matter how stealthily they approached the vicinity of her house when she reported his presence.</p><p>I had been doing as much general work as I could get, in part to keep my mind off the absence of Rachel and Sam. We had been apart, on and off, for about nine months. I'm not even sure how things had deteriorated so badly, and so quickly. It seemed like one minute they were there, filling the house with their scents and their sounds, and the next they were leaving for Rachel's parents' house, but, of course, it wasn't like that at all. Looking back, I could see every turn in the road, every dip and curve, that had led us to where we now were. It was supposed to be a temporary thing, a chance for both of us to consider, to take a little time out from each other and try to recall what it was about the other person with whom we shared our life that was so important to us we could not live without it. But such arrangements are never temporary, not really. There is a sundering, a rift that occurs, and even if an accommodation is reached, and a decision made to try again, the fact that one person left the other is never really forgotten, or forgiven. That makes it sound like it was her fault, but it wasn't. I'm not sure that it was mine either, not entirely. She had to make a choice, and so did I, but her choice was dependent upon the one that I made. In the end, I let them both go, but in the hope that they would return. We still talked, and I could see Sam whenever I wanted to, but the fact that they were over in Vermont made that a little difficult. Distances notwithstanding, I was careful about visiting, and not just because I didn't want to complicate an already difficult situation. I took care because I still believed that there were those who would hurt them to get at me. I think that was why I let them leave. It's so hard to remember now. The last year had been...difficult. I missed them a great deal, but I did not know either how to bring them back into my life, or how to live with their absence. They had left a void in my existence, and others had tried to take their place, the ones who waited in the shadows.</p><p>The first wife, and the first daughter.</p><p>I ordered coffee for Rebecca Clay. A beam of morning sunlight shone mercilessly upon her, exposing the lines in her face, the gray seeping into her hair despite the color job, the dark patches beneath her eyes.

Hallucinatory and feverishly hermetic, it is an acknowledged masterpiece of world literature, still unrivaled for its haunting blend of sensuous detail and otherworldly astonishment. In Ashbery's translation of this notoriously elusive text, the acclaimed poet and translator lends his inimitable voice to a venerated classic.<br><br> W. H. Auden recognized the strong affinities between Ashbery's poetry and Rimbaud's <em>Illuminations</em> in his 1956 introduction to Ashbery's first book, <em>Some Trees</em>, noting that "the imaginative life of the human individual stubbornly continues to live by the old magical notions." And it is here, in the "crystalline jumble" and "disordered collection of magic lantern slides" of <em>Illuminations</em>, as Ashbery writes in the Preface, that we can rediscover this essential lineage. "Absolute modernity" was for Rimbaud "acknowledging the simultaneity of all of life, the condition that nourishes poetry at every second. [...] If we are absolutely modern?and we are?it's because Rimbaud commanded us to be."<br><br> Ashbery's idiomatic and lyrical translations of these forty-four texts convey the originality of Rimbaud's vision to English-speaking readers of a new century.</p><p><p>Unknown beyond the avant-garde at the time of his death in 1891, <strong>Arthur Rimbaud</strong> has become one of the most liberating influences on twentieth-century culture. Born Jean Nicolas Arthur Rimbaud in Charleville, France, in 1854, Rimbaud&#x2019;s family moved to Cours d&#x2019;Orl�ans, when he was eight, where he began studying both Latin and Greek at the Pension Rossat. While he disliked school, Rimbaud excelled in his studies and, encouraged by a private tutor, tried his hand at poetry. Shortly thereafter, Rimbaud sent his work to the renowned symbolist poet Paul Verlaine and received in response a one-way ticket to Paris. By late September 1871, at the age of sixteen, Rimbaud had ignited with Verlaine one of the most notoriously turbulent affairs in the history of literature. Their relationship reached a boiling point in the summer of 1873, when Verlaine, frustrated by an increasingly distant Rimbaud, attacked his lover with a revolver in a drunken rage. The act sent Verlaine to prison and Rimbaud back to Charleville to finish his work on <em>A Season in Hell</em>. The following year, Rimbaud traveled to London with the poet Germain Nouveau, to compile and publish his transcendent <em>Illuminations</em>. It was to be Rimbaud&#x2019;s final publication. By 1880, he would give up writing altogether for a more stable life as merchant in Yemen, where he stayed until a painful condition in his knee forced him back to France for treatment. In 1891, Rimbaud was misdiagnosed with a case of tuberculosis synovitis and advised to have his leg removed. Only after the amputation did doctors determine Rimbaud was, in fact, suffering from cancer. Rimbaud died in Marseille in November of 1891, at the age of 37. He is now considered a saint to symbolists and surrealists, and his body of works, which include <em>Le bateau ivre</em> (1871), <em>Une Saison en Enfer</em> (1873), and <em>Les Illuminations</em> (1873), have been widely recognized as a major influence on artists stretching from Pablo Picasso to Bob Dylan.</p><p>Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning poet <strong>John Ashbery</strong> (1927&#x2015;2017) translated many French writers, including Alfred Jarry, Pierre Reverdy, and Raymond Roussel. In 2011 he was awarded the National Book Foundation&#x2019;s Lifetime Achievement Award.</p>&#x201c;John Ashbery has gifted us with an exquisite, untainted translation of Rimbaud; a transmission as pure as a winged dove driven by snow.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Patti Smith</strong><br><br>&#x201c;More than a century after Arthur Rimbaud composed his <em>Illuminations</em>, they are reborn in John Ashbery's magnificent translation. It is fitting that the major American poet since Hart Crane and Wallace Stevens should give us this noble version of the precursor of all three.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Harold Bloom</strong><br><br>&#x201c;This is the book that made poetry modern, and John Ashbery's sizzling new translation lets Rimbaud's eerie grandeur burst into English. Finally we have the key to open the door onto these magic Illuminations, and all their 'elegance, knowledge, violence!' This is an essential volume, a true classic.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>J. D. McClatchy</strong><br><br>&#x201c;To translate from one language into another is to risk losing the force, the soul, of the original. But not in this instance of John Ashberry's splendid version of Rimbaud's <em>Illuminations</em>. "Wise music is missing from our desire," he writes in his English version of the last line of "Conte" ("Tale"), losing neither the substance nor the truth of Rimbaud's great poetry.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Paula Fox, author of <em>Desperate Characters</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A marriage divine.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Joy Williams, author of <i>State of Grace</i></strong></p><h2>Dulac</h2><p>Binding is tight.

Formed in Haight-Ashbury in 1966 by members of R. G. Davis&#39;s subversive theater company, the San Francisco Mime Troupe, the Diggers took their name from the English Diggers, a seventeenth century agrarian collective devoted to creating a utopian society free of ownership and commerce. The San Francisco Diggers - under the leadership of Peter Berg, Emmett Grogan, Peter Coyote, and Billy Murcott - were true anarchists, with roots in the Theater of the Absurd, Existentialism, and strategies of direct action. They coined slogans designed to prod people into participating and staged art happenings, public interventions, and street theater infused with wicked humor. The Diggers also provided free food, clothing, medical care and lodging to anyone in need as part of their effort to create a unified and mutually supportive community. A critically important part of their methodology were the hundreds of broadsides that they regularly produced and distributed throughout the Haight, printed by the Communication Company, a maverick, short-lived publishing outfit founded by Chester Anderson and Claude Hayward. A selection of these graphically inventive, lacerating and sometimes funny broadsides are gathered together for the first time in Notes From a Revolution, which offers a fascinating and oddly moving record of the counterculture in its early bloom.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Murakami</h2><p>Takashi Murakami is one of contemporary art&#x2019;s most innovative and important figures. Drawing from street culture, high art, and traditional Japanese painting, Murakami takes the contemporary art trend of mixing high and low to an unprecedented level (critics call him the new Warhol), producing original paintings and sculptures as well as mass-produced consumer objects such as toys, books, and most famously, a line of handbags for Louis Vuitton. A committed supporter and spokesperson for Japanese artists and a powerful commentator on postwar culture and society, Murakami has organized influential exhibitions of Japanese art as well as a biannual art fair in Tokyo. Murakami has positioned himself as a new type of artist for the twenty-first century: a hybrid of creator, entrepreneur, and cultural ambassador.In conjunction with the first major retrospective of his work, <i>Murakami</i> traces Murakami&#x2019;s global impact socially, culturally, and art historically. Essays focus on Murakami&#x2019;s early works, which were based on a social critique of Japan&#x2019;s rampant consumerism; the development of his characters; his work with anime, fantasy; otaku culture; and his engagement with global pop culture. Representing output from original works of art to mass-produced multiples, the catalogue also considers the implications of Murakami&#x2019;s working methods within the tradition of the Western avant-garde.</p><p><b>Takashi Murakami</b> was born in Tokyo in 1962 and received his BFA, MFA and PhD from the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music. His work has been exhibited in prestigious museums all over the world. <b>Paul Schimmel</b> is Chief Curator of The Museum of Contemporary, Los Angeles, where he has organized numerous ground-breaking exhibitions. <b>Lisa Gabrielle Mark</b> is Director of Publications at The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. She has written widely on contemporary art.The decisive influence of Japan upon the development of contemporary culture needs little recounting. Western artists, from Manet and Monet forward, have adapted design principles found in Japanese prints to create compositions of increasing flatness and abstraction. The philosophy of Zen Buddhism has influenced a range of practices in Western painting, music, and dance since the mid-twentieth century. In recent decades, Japanese consumer products--from electronics to automobiles--have profoundly affected societies worldwide, while the products of Japanese popular culture--anime and manga in particular--have found an international audience. In his work and unique practice, Takashi Murakami seemingly picks out and reconfigures the disparate threads of Japanese influence that have been woven into the fabric of international culture over the last one hundred-plus years. If only for this reason, Murakami has swiftly risen to the position of one of the most influential and acclaimed artists to emerge from Asia in the postwar era. Murakami is now a distinct "brand"; his career is marked by extraordinary levels of ambition and achievement, and his work offers a brilliant and unique synthesis of the personal and the commercial. Trained in the school of nihonga--traditional Japanese-style painting--Murakami has created works that bridge that tradition and the worlds of contemporary art, design, animation, fashion, and popular culture. Extending the trajectory of production by artists such as Andy Warhol and Jeff Koons, his oeuvre not only includes painting, sculpture, installation, and animation, but also a wide range of collectibles, multiples, and commercial products. Murakami expands the role of the artist well beyond its traditional boundaries--Western or Japanese. In conjunction with heading his international corporation Kaikai Kiki Co., Ltd., which has three locations in Japan and New York, he continues to incorporate a vast range of activities, taking on the responsibilities of curator, entrepreneur, publisher, lecturer, events coordinator, and manager. The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MOCA), has been privileged to host Murakami on several previous occasions. In 2001, the influential "Superflat," a Murakami-organized exhibition of work by young Japanese artists, inaugurated MOCA's Pacific Design Center gallery. That same year, his work was featured in "Public Offerings," organized by Chief Curator Paul Schimmel. In 2004, Aya Takano, an artist managed by Murakami who also participated in "Superflat," launched The world after 800,000,000 years for MOCA's online digital gallery. Most recently, in 2005, Murakami's DOB in the Strange Forest and Super Nova (both 1999) were on display at The Geffen Contemporary at MOCA as a part of "Ecstasy: In and About Altered States," also organized by Schimmel. MOCA's ongoing relationship with Murakami culminates in "� Murakami," the artist's largest survey exhibition to date, including over ninety works from his extensive oeuvre, a broad range of Kaikai Kiki merchandise, and a fully operational Louis Vuitton boutique featuring new designs by the artist as an integral element of the exhibition. "� Murakami" continues the museum's longstanding dedication to the organization and presentation of exhibitions by exceptional and challenging mid-career artists, including Douglas Gordon, Rodney Graham, Barbara Kruger, Gabriel Orozco, Charles Ray, and Christopher Wool. This exhibition would not have been possible without the tremendous vision of Paul Schimmel, whose own passion and excitement for Murakami's work has fueled their ongoing relationship over the years. Schimmel, who gained Murakami's attention with his landmark 1992 show "Helter Skelter: L.A. Art in the 1990s" at MOCA, has been pivotal in creating a basis for understanding the artist's work in Los Angeles through exhibitions such as "Public Offerings" and "Ecstasy." Working closely with the artist with the assistance of Mika Yoshitake, project coordinator, and Yuko Sakata, executive director of Kaikai Kiki Co., Ltd., Schimmel has tailored an outstanding exhibition that will present Murakami's work in its full breadth to American and European audiences. Exhibitions like "� Murakami," unusual for art museums in their scale, ambition, and complexity, rely upon the most devoted and visionary supporters for their realization. I wish to express my unending gratitude to MOCA's extraordinary Board of Trustees, led by Chair Clifford J. Einstein, President Dallas Price-Van Breda, and Vice Chair Michael Sandler, for their commitment, with special thanks to Audrey Irmas through the Sydney Irmas Exhibition Endowment, William and Maria Bell, Dallas Price-Van Breda, and Tom and Janet Unterman for their particular support. I am deeply grateful to exhibition sponsors Blum &amp; Poe, Steven and Alexandra Cohen, Kathi and Gary Cypres, Gagosian Gallery, Galerie Emmanuel Perrotin, The Norton Family Foundation, Marianne Boesky, David Teiger, The MOCA Contemporaries, The Japan Foundation, and the E. Rhodes and Leona B. Carpenter Foundation. My most profound gratitude goes to Takashi Murakami for his revelatory and transformative work, his commitment to MOCA, and his tireless dedication to this exhibition. His energy and the amazing efforts of Kaikai Kiki Co., Ltd., have brought this exhibition to the highest level.</p><h2>A Body to Die For</h2><p>In the follow-up to the bestselling If Looks Could Kill, magazine writer-turned- sleuth Bailey Weggins takes a spa vacation--and finds murder. Bailey Weggins is in desperate need of a little R&amp;R after solving the murder of her boss' nanny. A trip to the Cedar Inn Spa seems like the perfect remedy. But when Bailey goes to the massage room to retrieve her lost watch and finds a dead body getting a seaweed wrap, her detective instincts are unable to go on hiatus. As Bailey uncovers the victim's mysterious past, she finds herself becoming infatuated with Jeffrey Beck, a detective working on the case. Meanwhile, another horrifying murder is committed at the inn--and Bailey finds herself the killer's next target.</p><p>Kate White lives in New York City.In this follow up to White's debut, IF LOOKS COULD KILL, narrator Kate Walsh gives a convincing performance as Bailey Weggins, a likable and level-headed freelance true crime journalist. While on a much needed vacation at a bed and breakfast owned by a close friend, Weggins is drawn into an investigation when a popular massage therapist is murdered. A powerful attraction to the local police detective complicates Weggins's participation in the pursuit of the killer. It also confuses her feelings regarding a current love interest back in the city. Humor, sex, romance, well-conceived characters, and a cleverly structured plot make this a satisfying read. Walsh's fine narration brings it all together nicely.

Karin, the middle child of an ancient vampire family, is a kind of vampire-in-reverse. Instead of feeding off victims, as her dream-boat older brother does, she must bite humans and donate blood. Karin is torn between wanting to be a normal girl and her nature, which is something of an embarrassment among vampires. The art is standard manga and doesn't do much to advance the characters, but sets the spooky, noirish scene. Both plot and characters are well-defined, with Karin's little sister, the bat-controlling Anju, the most intriguing player. Karin's predicament echoes the embarrassment of becoming a woman; her blood-cravings are monthly, and unless she controls them, her desire for the new boy, Usiu, will drive her from school. Though Karin's nose bleeds are a bit gross, the story works for all ages without being trivial. This could end up being a strong series that appeals both to younger, horror-loving neo-goth chicks and to the standard shojo crowd. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Her classic <i>Little Women </i>has been a mainstay of American literature since its release nearly 150 years ago, as Jo March and her calm, beloved &#x201c;Marmee&#x201d; have shaped and inspired generations of young women. Biographers have consistently attributed Louisa&#x2019;s uncommon success to her father, Bronson Alcott, assuming that this outspoken idealist was the source of his daughter&#x2019;s progressive thinking and remarkable independence. <br><br>But in this riveting dual biography, award-winning biographer Eve LaPlante explodes these myths, drawing from a trove of surprising new documents to show that it was Louisa&#x2019;s actual &#x201c;Marmee,&#x201d; Abigail May Alcott, who formed the intellectual and emotional center of her world. Abigail, whose difficult life both inspired and served as a warning to her devoted daughters, pushed Louisa to excel at writing and to chase her unconventional dreams in a male-dominated world. <br><br>In <i>Marmee &amp; Louisa, </i>LaPlante, Abigail&#x2019;s great-niece and Louisa&#x2019;s cousin, re-creates their shared story from diaries, letters, and personal papers, some recently discovered in a family attic and many others that were thought to have been destroyed. Here at last Abigail is revealed in her full complexity&#x2014;long dismissed as a quiet, self-effacing background figure, she comes to life as a fascinating writer and thinker in her own right. A politically active feminist firebrand, she was a highly opinionated, passionate, ambitious woman who fought for universal civil rights, publicly advocating for abolition, women&#x2019;s suffrage, and other defin-ing moral struggles of her era. <br><br>In this groundbreaking work, LaPlante paints an exquisitely moving and utterly convincing portrait of a woman decades ahead of her time, and the fiercely independent daughter whose life was deeply entwined with her mother&#x2019;s dreams of freedom. This gorgeously written story of two extraordinary women is guaranteed to transform our view of one of America&#x2019;s most beloved authors.</p><p><b>Eve LaPlante</b> is a great niece and a first cousin of Abigail and Louisa May Alcott.

She lives with her family in New England.<b>Introduction</b><br><br>Who is Louie?&#x201d; my oldest daughter asked, holding up a small book with a worn, embossed cover.1 She and I were kneeling on the dusty floor of my mother&#x2019;s attic, rummaging through a huge metal trunk containing our ancestors&#x2019; belongings. The trunk had arrived decades earlier following the death of an aunt, who likewise had inherited it from her aunt. Inside the trunk, beneath feathered ladies&#x2019; hats and a nineteenth-century quilt, my daughter had found an 1849 edition of <i>The Swiss Family Robinson,</i> inscribed as a gift:<br> <br><i>June 21st / 55.</i><br> <br> <i>George E. May</i><br> <br> <i>from his cousin</i><br> <br> <i>Louie</i><br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s Louisa May Alcott,&#x201d; I realized, remembering that relatives knew her as Louie or Cousin Louisa. In June 1855, our great-uncle George E. May was ten years old and his first cousin Louisa May Alcott, who hoped he would enjoy the tale of a shipwrecked family, was twenty-two. She was staying with other maternal cousins in Walpole, New Hampshire, spending her days gardening and hiking, forming a theater troupe, and inventing &#x201c;little tales&#x201d; that she hoped to sell.2 Her parents and younger sisters would soon join her in Walpole, a &#x201c;lovely place, high among the hills,&#x201d; to live in an uncle&#x2019;s spare house.3 Deeply in debt, they could not afford to pay rent. Their only regular income in 1855 was her older sister&#x2019;s small salary as a teacher in Syracuse, New York, where she boarded with George&#x2019;s family. Louisa&#x2019;s father, Bronson, recently returned from an unprofitable lecture tour of the Midwest, was planning a solo trip to England&#x2014;&#x201c;not a wise idea,&#x201d; according to Louisa. Her mother, Abigail, had left jobs in Boston as a social worker and employment agent. The novel <i>Little Women,</i> which would give the Alcotts their first taste of financial security, was still thirteen years in the future. But Louisa had already published poems, short stories, and a book of original fairy tales, the start of her remarkable career.<br> <br>In another trunk my daughter and I found the brittle, handwritten memoir of George&#x2019;s older sister, my great-great-grandmother Charlotte May, who had grown up with Louisa and whose wedding Louisa had recently attended. Charlotte and Louisa, born a few months apart in the winter of 1832&#x2013;33, had played games, invented stories, and wandered the woods and hills surrounding their childhood homes. A packet of letters tied with a ribbon contained Charlotte&#x2019;s scribbled descriptions of her and Louisa&#x2019;s teenage escapades in Syracuse in the late 1840s. Louisa signed letters to Charlotte, who lacked sisters, &#x201c;Your sister-in-love.&#x201d;4<br> <br>Charlotte and George May&#x2019;s father, the Reverend Samuel Joseph May, was likewise his nieces&#x2019; &#x201c;uncle father.&#x201d;5 Samuel Joseph had introduced his youngest sister, Abigail May, to Bronson Alcott in 1827 and spent decades providing their family with much-needed financial and emotional support. Samuel Joseph&#x2019;s published memoir, stuffed with letters in his elegant hand dated from the 1820s to the 1860s, was also in my mother&#x2019;s attic, along with a crumbling copy of his 1869 <i>Recollections of Our Antislavery Conflict</i> and an 1823 Bible that belonged to his wife, Lucretia, who became Abigail May Alcott&#x2019;s closest friend.<br> <br>At the time of these discoveries, I knew next to nothing about the Mays and the Alcotts, and little of Louisa except for her juvenile fiction, <i>Little Women, Little Men,</i> and the rest, which I had devoured as a child. But the treasures in the attic compelled me to explore the mysteries of the May-Alcott family. Their faded, cracking pages led me to read Louisa&#x2019;s novels and stories for adults, her letters and journals, and the writings of her parents, sisters, and other close relatives.<br> <br>In the process, I encountered a paradox. While Marmee, Abigail May Alcott&#x2019;s alter ego in <i>Little Women,</i> is universally acknowledged as the central figure in her children&#x2019;s lives, the flesh-and-blood Abigail seemed in the standard rendition of the Alcott saga to be practically invisible and almost mute. Abigail&#x2019;s letters and journals, unlike those of her daughter and husband, remained unpublished and largely unexplored.<br> <br>The more I learned about the Alcotts, though, the more I saw Louisa and Abigail as a pair, each one the person in the world to whom the other felt closest. It was clear that this mother and daughter shared a profound intimacy that had light and dark facets, in which a fierce commitment to female independence coexisted with a mutual dependency. Abigail, I realized, was a vibrant writer, brilliant teacher, and passionate reformer who spent decades working to abolish slavery, ameliorate urban poverty, and allow women to be educated, vote, and engage in public life. She nurtured and fostered Louisa&#x2019;s career as a writer and entrepreneur, encouraging her daughter, rejection after rejection, to persist. Louisa in turn dedicated all her early work, starting with her first novel at age sixteen, to her mother, who possessed a &#x201c;nobility of character and talents,&#x201d; Madelon Bedell observed in her biography of the family.6 &#x201c;Louisa was to take these sensibilities and talents and transform them into art and literature . . . . If her fame continues to endure and her mother&#x2019;s name is unknown, nonetheless the achievement is a dual one; behind the legendary figure of Louisa May Alcott stands the larger-than-life model of her mother, Abby May.&#x201d; Louisa created &#x201c;a distinctly mother-centered .7 . . fictional universe,&#x201d; according to another scholar, Monika Elbert, &#x201c;in which children seek a nurturing home, husbands [seek] maternal warmth in their wives, and orphans [seek] a mother-surrogate.&#x201d; Over the years, in fact, Louisa functioned as partner, provider, nurse, and even mother to Abigail. &#x201c;The great love of [Louisa May] Alcott&#x2019;s life . . . was doubtless her mother, whom she idealized as Marmee in <i>Little Women,</i>&#x201d; Elizabeth Lennox Keyser wrote. In short, Abigail was Louisa&#x2019;s muse.<br> <br>Yet Abigail&#x2019;s story seemed never to have been told. Basic facts, such as the place of her birth, remained undiscovered.8 Abigail was always portrayed as a housewife, while her husband was seen as Louisa&#x2019;s mentor. &#x201c;Louisa May Alcott was so dominated by her father,&#x201d; the biographer Susan Cheever wrote, &#x201c;that it is hard to unravel their lives from each other.9 . . . In every big decision [Louisa] made, her father hovers in the background. His hold on her was incalculable.&#x201d; Madelon Bedell referred to &#x201c;Bronson Alcott&#x2019;s great-granddaughter&#x201d; as if she were not also descended from Abigail. &#x201c;Even though [Bronson is] hardly present in [<i>Little Women</i>], his was the powerful personality that lay at the heart of the legend&#x201d; of Louisa May Alcott.10 Collections of American literature invariably described Louisa as the student of men: &#x201c;Raised in Concord, Massachusetts, and educated by her father, Alcott came under the influence of the great men of his circle: Emerson, Hawthorne, the preacher Theodore Parker, and Thoreau.&#x201d;11 Even a feminist study of nineteenth-century women writers suggested that Abigail exerted no intellectual influence on Louisa, who &#x201c;was taught by her father and also introduced to men of great influence, including Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne and Henry David Thoreau.&#x201d;12 No anthology or biography portrayed Louisa as &#x201c;taught by her mother and also introduced to women of great influence, including Elizabeth Palmer Peabody, Lydia Maria Child, and Margaret Fuller.&#x201d; Yet that statement, I discovered, is equally true.<br> <br>Perhaps Abigail&#x2019;s absence shouldn&#x2019;t have surprised me. Invisibility is the lot of most women of the past. With few exceptions, women appear in historical records only when they were born, married, and died, if they are remembered at all. The eleven-page chronology of Louisa&#x2019;s life compiled by the editors of her published papers mentions her father repeatedly but her mother just four times:<br> <br>Abigail May is born<br> <br>Bronson Alcott and Abigail May are married in Boston<br> <br>Mrs. Alcott&#x2019;s final illness begins<br> <br>Mrs. Alcott dies<br> <br>A woman who was pregnant at least eight times and bore five children was not credited in the chronology with even giving birth: &#x201c;Louisa May Alcott is born.&#x201d;13 One might infer that Abigail was barely present in the Alcott home and had not a thought in her head.<br> <br>How is it that the woman behind Marmee, the cornerstone of Louisa&#x2019;s most famous work, would have had nothing to say? One possible explanation is that Abigail is hiding in plain sight. As readers of <i>Little Women,</i> we feel we know Louisa&#x2019;s mother because we know the mother in Louisa&#x2019;s book. As a result, Louisa&#x2019;s literary creation may obscure the flesh-and-blood Abigail.<br> <br>There is another explanation for our lack of knowledge of Abigail, or so we&#x2019;ve been led to believe. Abigail&#x2019;s letters and journals were all destroyed, burned by her husband and daughter after she died. Louisa wrote in her journal in the spring of 1882, &#x201c;[I] Read over &amp; destroyed Mother&#x2019;s Diaries as she wished me to do.&#x201d; Apparently, she and her parents wished to eradicate these papers in order to maintain the family&#x2019;s privacy, to protect Bronson&#x2019;s reputation, and, ironically, to preserve Abigail&#x2019;s image as an avatar of docile, nineteenth-century womanhood. The biographer John Matteson concluded that &#x201c;instead of weaving her mother&#x2019;s writings into a published work, [Louisa] chose to commit the great majority of them to the flames.14 Her decision has cost historians priceless insights into the mind of an extraordinary woman&#x201d;&#x2014;an extraordinary woman who cannot be known. According to conventional wisdom, Abigail&#x2019;s inner life was a mystery because she left no significant record of her thoughts.<br> <br>The conventional wisdom turned out to be wrong. Louisa did weave her mother&#x2019;s writings into published works. Throughout the 1860s, as she composed short stories, adult novels, and <i>Little Women,</i> she pored over her mother&#x2019;s private journals, mining them for material. Her claims of burning the family papers are exaggerations.15 Louisa wrote to a friend in January 1883, &#x201c;My journals were all burnt long ago in terror of gossip when I depart &amp; on unwise use of my very frank records of people &amp; events.&#x201d;16<br> <br>In fact, however, hundreds of pages of Louisa&#x2019;s journals are in the archives at Harvard University, which holds the largest collection of Alcott papers in the world. These archives also contain hundreds of pages of Abigail&#x2019;s diaries as well as thirty-six years of Abigail&#x2019;s personal correspondence with her brother Samuel Joseph. These letters have &#x201c;a remarkable vivacity,&#x201d; in the words of Madelon Bedell. &#x201c;In some ways, Abby was a better writer than her more famous daughter.&#x201d;17 Cornell University&#x2019;s collection of May Papers contains more unpublished family diaries and personal correspondence. Unknown papers of the Alcotts continue to be discovered. The historical society of a village in western Maine where Abigail worked in 1848 referred me to a local historian, who revealed to me that he had letters written by Abigail that year to his great-grandmother. In addition to visiting his farmhouse in the foothills of the Mahoosuc Mountains and reading those letters, I explored the sites of Abigail&#x2019;s and Louisa&#x2019;s lives in Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania, New York, and throughout New England.<br> <br>My research exploded a number of myths about the Alcotts that have arisen as a consequence of <i>Little Women</i>. Unlike the fictional March family, the Alcotts were homeless for decades. Abigail regularly begged for money from family and friends. Her marriage was deeply distressed.18 For years she functioned as a single parent, whose despair over her husband&#x2019;s inattention, absences, and inability to earn a living caused her at least once to pack and move out with her four children. For Louisa, who was ten years old, seeing her parents&#x2019; marriage disintegrate motivated her to become her mother&#x2019;s provider and support. For much of Louisa&#x2019;s childhood her father, even when at home, often seemed absent. Her mother, in contrast, was always present, urging her on and serving as her intellectual mentor and literary forebear.<br> <br>In addition to challenging the myths and misconceptions about the Alcotts and especially about Abigail, <i>Marmee &amp; Louisa</i> offers answers to questions that readers continue to ask about Louisa. Why did she never leave home? Why did she not marry? Who was the real Mr. March? Where did Louisa May Alcott find the material to describe a happy childhood?<br> <br>While writing this book, I came to see that many of the dilemmas that Abigail and Louisa faced in the nineteenth century were not unlike the dilemmas we face today: How to balance work and love? How to combine a public life with a private one? How to live out one&#x2019;s ideals without doing harm? How to hold one&#x2019;s children close while encouraging their independence? How to find a voice in a world that does not listen?<br> <br><i>Marmee &amp; Louisa</i> is the story of two visionary women, perhaps the most famous mother-daughter pair in American literary history. Louisa and Abigail were born into a world that constrained and restricted them, but they dreamed of freedom. The story of their struggle to forge a new world begins with Abigail. Indeed, we cannot understand Louisa without knowing her mother. You may find, as I have, that aspects of Abigail&#x2019;s life are strangely familiar, as if we had encountered her before. In a way we have, through her daughter&#x2019;s writing. The imaginative child of an inspirational mother, Louisa studied Abigail&#x2019;s life and character, appropriated them, and embedded them in her fictional worlds.|<i>Chapter One</i><br><br><b>A Good Child, but Willful</b><br> <br>On Wednesday, October 8, 1800, in a large frame house on Milk Street overlooking Boston Harbor, Dorothy Sewall May delivered her fourth living daughter, whom she named Abigail, after her husband&#x2019;s mother.19 &#x201c;[I was] a sickly child, nursed by a sickly mother,&#x201d; Abigail recalled, linked from the start to her own &#x201c;Marmee.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dorothy Sewall May&#x2019;s &#x201c;most striking trait&#x201d; was &#x201c;her affectionate disposition,&#x201d; according to Abigail.22 &#x201c;She adored her husband and children.&#x201d;20 This natural tendency was intensified because Dorothy had been orphaned at twelve when her father died of a stroke, a year after the death of her forty-year-old mother.21 Thereafter Dorothy had lived with her eldest sister, Elizabeth Sewall Salisbury. Elizabeth&#x2019;s husband, Samuel, was a merchant whose apprentice, Joseph May, Dorothy married in 1784.<br> <br>By the time of Abigail&#x2019;s birth sixteen years later, the Mays had three boys&#x2014;ages twelve, five, and three&#x2014;and four girls: thirteen-year-old Catherine; Louisa, who was eleven; two-year-old Elizabeth, whom they called Eliza; and the new baby. Dorothy had no formal education and her husband had abandoned Boston Latin School in his early teens to work for Dorothy&#x2019;s brother-in-law. Nevertheless, she determined to send their boys at age five to dame, or ma&#x2019;am, schools run by women and then to &#x201c;man schools&#x201d; to prepare for Harvard College, from which her brother, father, grandfathers, and great-grandfathers had graduated. As for her daughters, Dorothy encouraged them to follow a year or two of dame school with reading, singing, and sewing at home, where she provided tutors in dancing and music.

Sometimes you know when a story begins...<br><b>2</b><br>When the day comes that I am asked to recalibrate the calendar, I am going to lop a week off January and February and add them to October, which deserves to be forty days long, maybe more.<br><br>I love this time of year. The tourists have long gone and the kids are back at school. The TV schedules aren&#x2019;t full of reruns and I can sleep under a duvet again. Mostly I love the sparkle in the air, without the pollen from the plane trees so I can open my lungs and run freely.<br><br>I run every morning&#x2014;three circuits of Victoria Park in Bethnal Green, each one of them more than a mile. Right now I&#x2019;m just passing Durward Street in Whitechapel. Jack the Ripper territory. I once took a Ripper walking tour, a pub crawl with ghost stories. The victim I remember best was his last one, Mary Kelly, who died on the same date as my birthday, November the ninth.<br><br>People forget how small an area Jack roamed. Spitalfields, Shoreditch and Whitechapel cover less than a square mile, yet in 1888 more than a million people were crammed into slums, without decent water and sewerage. It is still overcrowded and poor but that's only compared to places like Hampstead or Chiswick or Holland Park. Poverty is a relative state in a rich country where the wealthiest are the first to cry poor.<br><br>It is seven years since I last ran competitively, on a September night in Birmingham, under lights. I wanted to get to the Sydney Olympics but only two of us were going to make it. Four&#x2013;hundredths of a second separated first from fifth; half a meter, a heartbeat, a broken heart.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t run to win anymore. I run because I can and because I'm fast. Fast enough to blur at the edges. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m here now, flirting with the ground while perspiration leaks between my breasts, plastering my T&#x2013;shirt to my stomach.<br><br>When I run my thoughts become clearer, or at least concentrated. Mostly I think about work and imagine that today someone will call and offer me my old job back.<br><br>A year ago I helped solve a kidnapping and find a missing girl. One of the kidnappers dropped me onto a wall, crushing my spine. After six operations and nine months of physiotherapy I am fit again, with more steel in my spine than England&#x2019;s back four. Unfortunately, nobody seems to know what to do with me at the Metropolitan Police. I am a wonky wheel on the machine.<br><br>As I pass the playground, I notice a man sitting on a bench reading a newspaper. There is no child on the climbing frame behind him and other benches are in sunshine. Why has he chosen the shade?<br><br>In his mid&#x2013;thirties, dressed in a shirt and tie, he doesn't raise his eyes as I pass. He&#x2019;s studying a crossword. What sort of man does a crossword in a park at this hour of the morning? A man who can't sleep. A man who waits.<br><br>Up until a year ago I used to watch people for a living. I guarded diplomats and visiting heads of state, ferrying their wives on shopping trips to Harrods and dropping their children at school. It is probably the most boring job in the Metropolitan Police but I was good at it. During five years with the Diplomatic Protection Group I didn't fire a shot in anger or miss one of the wives' hair appointments. I was like one of those soldiers who sit in the missile silos, praying the phone never rings.<br><br>On my second circuit of the park he is still there. His suede jacket is lying across his lap. He has freckles and smooth brown hair, cut symmetrically and parted to the left. A leather briefcase is tucked close to his side.<br><br>A gust of wind tears the newspaper from his fingers. Three steps and I reach it first. It wraps around my thigh.<br><br>For a moment he wants to retreat, as if he's too close to the edge. His freckles make him look younger. His eyes don't meet mine. Instead he bunches his shoulders shyly and says thank you. The front page is still wrapped around my thigh. For a moment I'm tempted to have some fun. I could make a joke about feeling like tomorrow&#x2019;s fish&#x2013;and&#x2013;chips.<br><br>The breeze feels cool on my neck. &#x201c;Sorry, I&#x2019;m rather sweaty.&#x201d;<br><br>He touches his nose nervously, nods and touches his nose again.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you run every day?&#x201d; he asks suddenly.<br><br>&#x201c;I try to.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How far?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Four miles.&#x201d;<br><br>It&#x2019;s an American accent. He doesn&#x2019;t know what else to say.<br><br>&#x201c;I have to keep going. I don&#x2019;t want to cool down.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay. Sure. Have a nice day.&#x201d; It doesn&#x2019;t sound so trite coming from an American.<br><br>On my third circuit of the park the bench is empty. I look for him along the street but there are no silhouettes. Normal service has been resumed.<br><br>Farther along the street, just visible on the corner, a van is parked at the curb. As I draw nearer, I notice a white plastic tent over missing paving stones. A metal cage is propped open around the hole. They&#x2019;ve started work early.<br><br>I do this sort of thing&#x2014;take note of people and vehicles. I look for things that are out of the ordinary; people in the wrong place, or the wrong clothes; cars parked illegally; the same face in different locations. I can&#x2019;t change what I am.<br><br>Unlacing my trainers, I pull a key from beneath the insole and unlock my front door. My neighbor, Mr. Mordecai, waves from his window. I once asked him his first name and he said it should be Yo&#x2019;man.<br><br>&#x201c;Why&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because that's what my boys call me: &#x2018;Yo man, can I have some money?&#x2019; &#x2018;Yo man, can I borrow the car?&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>His laugh sounded like nuts falling on a roof.<br><br>In the kitchen I pour myself a large glass of water and drink it greedily. Then I stretch my quads, balancing one leg on the back of a chair.<br><br>The mouse living under my fridge chooses that moment to appear. It is a very ambivalent mouse, scarcely bothering to lift its head to acknowledge me. And it doesn't seem to mind that my youngest brother, Hari, keeps setting mousetraps. Perhaps it knows that I disarm them, taking off the cheese when Hari isn't around.<br><br>The mouse finally looks up at me, as though about to complain about the lack of crumbs. Then it sniffs the air and scampers away.<br><br>Hari appears in the doorway, bare-chested and barefooted. Opening the fridge, he takes out a carton of orange juice and unscrews the plastic lid. He looks at me, considers his options, and gets a glass from the cupboard. Sometimes I think he is prettier than I am. He has longer lashes and thicker hair.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you going to the reunion tonight?&#x201d; I ask.<br><br>&#x201c;Nope.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell me <i>you're</i> going!

And how does a fifteen-year-old American boy go from star quarterback to trained assassin, surging up the cartel corporate ladder?<br> <br>At first glance, Gabriel Cardona is the poster boy American teenager: great athlete, bright, handsome, and charismatic. But the streets of his border town of Laredo, Texas, are poor and dangerous, and it isn&#x2019;t long before Gabriel abandons his promising future for the allure of the Zetas, a drug cartel with roots in the Mexican military. His younger friend Bart, as well as others from Gabriel&#x2019;s childhood, join him in working for the Zetas, boosting cars and smuggling drugs, eventually catching the eye of the cartel&#x2019;s leadership.<br> <br>Meanwhile, Mexican-born Detective Robert Garcia has worked hard all his life and is now struggling to raise his family in America. As violence spills over the border, Detective Garcia&#x2019;s pursuit of the boys, and their cartel leaders, puts him face to face with the urgent consequences of a war he sees as unwinnable.<br> <br>In <i>Wolf Boys</i> Dan Slater shares their stories, taking us from the Sierra Madre mountaintops to the dusty, dark alleys of Laredo, Texas, on a harrowing, often brutal journey into the heart of the Mexican drug trade. Gabriel&#x2019;s evolution from good-natured teenager into a feared assassin is as inevitable as Garcia&#x2019;s slow realization of the futile nature of his work. A nonfiction thriller, <i>Wolf Boys</i> depicts more than just Gabriel, Bart, and the officers who took them down. It shows, through vivid detail and rich, often moving, narrative, the way in which the border itself is changing, disappearing, and posing new, terrifying, and yet largely unseen threats to American security. Ultimately though, <i>Wolf Boys</i> is the intimate story of the &#x201c;lobos&#x201d; themselves: boys turned into pawns for cartels. Their stories show how poverty, ideas about identity, and government ignorance have warped the definition of the American dream.</p><p>A former reporter for <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, Dan Slater has written for <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>The Washington Post</i>, <i>The Boston Globe</i>, <i>New York</i> magazine, <i>The Atlantic</i>, <i>GQ</i>, and <i>Fast Company</i>.

Every accomplishment, it seemed, came with some deficit or drawback or innocence-eroding knowledge. You earned a scholarship but didn&#x2019;t feel college. You won the battle but lost the bonus. You fell in love, and faced a dishonorable discharge. The autumn of 1997 should&#x2019;ve been the brightest season in Robert&#x2019;s promising career, but it arrived with sorrow. The yin and the yang, he called it.<br> <br>Two decades earlier, as a child of Norma and Robert Sr., Robert emigrated from Piedras Negras, Mexico, to the Texas border town of Eagle Pass&#x2014;an international journey of one mile. Robert Sr., needing to support his family, had been working in the States as an illegal immigrant; once he demonstrated an income and showed that he was spending money in Texas, he gained a green card for the family, meaning that Norma, Robert Sr., Robert, and Robert&#x2019;s younger sister, Blanca, could come to the States as &#x201c;resident aliens,&#x201d; not U.S. citizens. After they arrived, Norma gave birth to another daughter, Diana, and another son, Jesse.<br> <br>Robert, the oldest, started third grade in an American school. After school and on weekends, he and Robert Sr. picked cucumbers, onions, and cantaloupes on local farms. In spring and summer, Norma, a seamstress for Dickie&#x2019;s, the work-wear manufacturer, stayed in Eagle Pass with the girls and Jesse while Robert and his father followed fellow migrants to Oregon and Montana for the sugar beet season. There, Robert attended migrant programs at local schools. Dark-skinned but ethnically ambiguous, he found northern communities mostly welcoming, with their food festivals and roadside stands where Indians sold tourist stuff. The verdant landscapes were a reprieve from the dusty flatiron of South Texas. America was a beautiful place.<br> <br>Back in Eagle Pass, land was cheap. There were no codes. People could build what they wanted. The Garcia family lived in a two-room hut while they built the home they&#x2019;d live in forever. It was piecework. They saved up, then tiled the bathroom; saved more, then bought a tub. In winter they heated the place with brazas, coal fires in barrels, and in the mornings Robert went to school smelling like smoke.<br> <br>When would the house be finished? No one asked. Work drew them together.<br> <br>As other immigrants settled nearby, Robert Sr. built a one-man concession stand where he sold snacks and sodas to neighborhood kids. Robert Sr. brought his family to the States for a better way of life, but in his mind he would always be Mexican. He was proud to live next to other immigrants in Eagle Pass. By the time Reagan took office, their patch of dirt was becoming a bona fide suburb, sprouting neat rows of handmade houses. When neighbors needed assistance with an addition or a plumbing issue, they turned to &#x201c;the Roberts&#x201d; for help.<br> <br>Robert Sr. treated his oldest boy like a man, and Robert&#x2019;s siblings respected him as a kind of second father. Trim, bony, and bespectacled, he walked taller than his five feet, eight inches. In high school, he enrolled in ROTC and played bass clarinet in the marching band. He finished high school a semester early, took a fast-food job at Long John Silver&#x2019;s, and deliberated over whether he should capitalize on a college scholarship in design, or go in a different direction.<br> <br>At seventeen he seemed to know himself: hyperactive, confident. He had a talent for improvisation. He was respectful in a rank-conscious way, but didn&#x2019;t care what others said or advised. Introverted and impatient, he had his own way of doing things. He learned as much from his father as he did in school. He also felt the lure of service, a patriotic duty toward the adopted country that gave him and his family so much. Formal education, he decided, was not for him. So, in the summer of 1986&#x2014;the same year a boy who would change Robert&#x2019;s life was born in Laredo, another Texas border town 140 miles southeast&#x2014;Robert, much to the dismay of his non-English-speaking parents, passed up the scholarship and enlisted in the U.S. Army.<br> <br>Since he&#x2019;d enrolled in ROTC during high school, he arrived at basic training as a seventeen-year-old platoon leader, instructing men who were older. To compensate for the age difference, and his small size, he acted extra tough and earned the nickname Little Hitler. After basic training, he began to work as a watercraft engineer at Fort Eustis, Virginia, where he picked up a mentor, a sergeant major, who led him to work on military bases in Spain and England. On the bases, he played baseball and lifted weights. Little Hitler sported ropy arms. His neck, once nerd-thin, disappeared into his shoulders.<br> <br>In the Azores islands, on a small U.S. Navy installation off the coast of Portugal, Robert met Veronica, a blond gringa from Arizona. The daughter of a navy man, Ronnie was the only female mechanic at the base. She was tough. While fixing the hydraulic system on a tugboat one day, Robert snuck up and slapped her neck with grease-shaft oil. She wheeled around, called him an asshole. &#x201c;Fuck off!&#x201d; she said. One week later they conceived a son.<br> <br>Ronnie was twenty, already married to a soldier, and had a two-year-old son. Her parents never liked her husband. As far as they were concerned, he was a freeloader who drank excessively at the bar they owned in Arizona. They didn&#x2019;t like seeing their daughter be the breadwinner and the parent. And now here was Robert: didn&#x2019;t drink, didn&#x2019;t smoke, would do anything for her.<br> <br>But adultery in the military was a serious crime; at the discretion of a military court, it carried felony time and a dishonorable discharge. The chiefs read Ronnie and Robert their rights. They owned up to the affair. Ronnie&#x2019;s husband flew to Portugal; furious, he stomped around the base, drank, got in fights, and broke windows at Ronnie&#x2019;s house. No one liked her husband. So the chiefs held a meeting to arbitrate the love triangle, and let Robert and Ronnie walk away with reprimands. When the husband called Ronnie&#x2019;s mother and said, &#x201c;Your daughter&#x2019;s a whore!&#x201d; Ronnie&#x2019;s father grabbed the phone and said: &#x201c;You weren&#x2019;t even born from a woman! Two freight trains bumped together and you fell out of a hobo&#x2019;s ass!&#x201d; From there, the separation went smoothly.<br> <br>In 1991, Robert&#x2019;s four-year military contract neared its end as the First Gulf War started. Robert saw other soldiers reenlisting and collecting $10,000 bonuses. He was willing to reenlist, until the U.S. government offered him citizenship instead of the bonus. Robert didn&#x2019;t care much about citizenship. Like his father, he&#x2019;d always think of himself as Mexican; and, besides, his resident-alien status entitled him to a U.S. passport. But he still took the denial of the bonus&#x2014;and the offer of citizenship as a substitute for the money that other soldiers received&#x2014;as an insult. How could he serve his country for four years and not get citizenship automatically? So he declined reenlistment, walked away with neither the bonus nor citizenship, and returned to Texas with Ronnie and the boys, where he got a job as a diesel mechanic in Laredo&#x2014;a border town neither of them knew.<br> <br>IF IT WAS YOUR FIRST time, you drove south on Interstate 35, passed San Antonio, and expected to hit the border, but the highway kept plunging south. Texas hill country flattened out into a plain so fathomlessly vast, it gave you a feeling of driving down into the end of the earth. One hundred twenty miles later, and still in America, you reached the spindly neon signs of hotels and fast-food joints, gazed back north, and felt as if what you&#x2019;d just traveled through was a buffer, neither here nor there. To the west, several blocks off I-35, rows of warehouses colonized the area around the railroad track. To the east, upper-middle-class suburbs gave way to sprawling developments, ghettos, and sub-ghettos called colonias. Go two more miles south, and I-35 dumped out at the border crossing, 1,600 miles south of the interstate&#x2019;s northern terminus in Duluth, Minnesota.<br> <br>Robert and Ronnie were small-town people. Sprawling Laredo, with its 125,000 residents, was a big city compared to a place like Eagle Pass, which had a population of fewer than 20,000.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh well,&#x201d; Ronnie sighed. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll try it for a year or two.&#x201d;<br> <br>A few months later, while recovering from a work-related hand injury, Robert saw an ad for the Laredo Police Department. He enjoyed public service more than working for a company. But he had to be a U.S. citizen to be a cop. He didn&#x2019;t see any benefit to citizenship, aside from this policing career, and wasn&#x2019;t feeling especially patriotic after his snub by the military. He wondered: What would his father do? His father would shut up and do right by his family. Land the career, move forward. So Robert studied, took the test, and took the oath of U.S. citizenship.<br> <br>When he joined the force, the Laredo Police Department employed about two hundred officers. Cops purchased their own guns. Uniforms consisted of jeans and denim shirts, to which wives sewed PD patches. Each patrol covered an enormous area. Squad cars called for backup, and good luck with that. But aside from domestic spats and some armed robbery, the city saw little violence. Across the river, Nuevo Laredo, with its larger population of 200,000 people, wasn&#x2019;t much worse. Drug and immigrant smuggling were rampant. But a smuggler&#x2019;s power came less from controlling territory with violence and intimidation than from the scope of his contacts in law enforcement and politics, and his ability to operate across Mexico with government protection. In exchange for bribes, politicians and cops refereed trafficking and settled disputes.<br> <br>Mexico&#x2019;s narcotics industry was well organized. The business consisted of two classes: producers and smugglers. On the western side of Mexico, in the fertile highlands of the Sierra Madre Occidental, gomeros&#x2014;drug farmers&#x2014;contracted with smuggling groups to move shipments north to border towns. In the states of Sinaloa, Durango, and Chihuahua, an ideal combination of altitude, rainfall, and soil acidity yielded bumper crops of Papaver somniferum. Those poppy fields&#x2014;some with origins in plantings made by Chinese immigrants a century earlier&#x2014;produced millions of metric tons of bulk opium per year. Marijuana, known by its slang, mota, was Mexico&#x2019;s other homegrown narcotic. When the marijuana craze hit the United States in the 1960s, mota came chiefly from the mountaintops of the Pacific states of Sinaloa and Sonora, then expanded to Nayarit, Jalisco, Guerrero, Veracruz, Oaxaca, Quintana Roo, and Campeche. The irrigated harvest for mota ran from February to March; the natural harvest from July to August. All merca, merchandise, had to reach the border by fall, November at the latest. Americans didn&#x2019;t work during the holidays.<br> <br>The large, curving horn of Mexico was anchored on two great mountain chains, or cordilleras, both rising from north to south, one on the east facing the green Gulf of Mexico, the other sloping westward to the blue Pacific Ocean. Between these mountain ranges, a high central plateau tapered down with the horn to the Yucat�n Peninsula. Eons ago, volcanoes cut the plateau into countless jumbled valleys with forests of pine, oak, fir, and alder. The coastal lands were tropically humid, but the plateau had a climate of eternal spring. It should&#x2019;ve been eminently fit for man.<br> <br>Instead, Mexico&#x2019;s future would be full of conquests, dictatorship, revolt, corruption, and crime.<br> <br>When Robert and Ronnie arrived in Laredo in 1991, the major crossings along the two-thousand-mile border between Mexico and America&#x2014;from east to west: Matamoros, Nuevo Laredo, Ju�rez, and Tijuana&#x2014;were controlled by &#x201c;smuggling families&#x201d; that straddled the border and charged a tax, known as a cuota or piso, which was in turn used to pay the bribes that secured the routes for trafficking in drugs and immigrants. Fights broke out between the families, and there was some spillover violence, but there were no cartels, not yet.<br> <br>Patrol officers in Laredo PD seized large quantities of narcotics and saw some dead guys left in the front yard. But nothing too graphic. The young cops, making their nine dollars per hour plus overtime, were cocky. They had no awareness of the larger world; everything revolved around them. Places like Florida, Colombia, Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Washington, D.C., were a world away, and changing. Drug-war politics were in flux. In Laredo, Robert and his partners knew little beyond their squad cars.<br> <br>As cops came up in PD, some set their sights on SWAT; others tried out state agencies like Child Protective Services and found that they didn&#x2019;t mind dealing with domestic nightmares. Robert liked drug work because of the local impact. A drug arrest wasn&#x2019;t mere pretext. You weren&#x2019;t just taking a guy with dope off the street. That guy also committed assaults and robberies to get drugs. If the guy was a big dealer, maybe he used kids as drug couriers and to operate &#x201c;stash houses,&#x201d; the places where dealers kept their drugs and money. Robert would stop a guy with a gram of coke or a pound of weed, or bust a house that sold heroin to local Laredo addicts. He&#x2019;d get his picture in the Laredo Morning Times perp-walking a guy to the local jail. He felt like he was &#x201c;sweeping the streets of crime.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d turn on the TV, see some Nancy Reagan&#x2013;type person telling everyone, &#x201c;Say no to drugs!&#x201d; and feel like Superman.<br> <br>THE LUMP-SUM PAYOUT RONNIE GOT when she left the military took some weight off her and Robert&#x2019;s life together. They paid cash for a mobile home in South Laredo. Robert&#x2019;s salary covered bills.<br> <br>Still, they were a young couple with two kids, trying to make it in a new city. There was plenty to fight about. One of about one thousand white people in a city where bloodlines and patronage determined jobs and social circles, Ronnie was more of an outsider than Robert. As a stay-at-home mom she felt isolated. Life in Laredo wasn&#x2019;t fulfilling. That was their biggest fight: She wanted to get out. When she did go looking for work, she felt lucky to get hired at a doctor&#x2019;s office, where she was told, &#x201c;You know, I like it that you&#x2019;re not from here.&#x201d;<br> <br>Later, Robert would learn to divide the cop persona from the father-husband. But in his twenties, the machismo kicked in at home. I&#x2019;m the man and you&#x2019;ll obey. I&#x2019;m going out tonight. There&#x2019;s nothing you can do about it. Ronnie was dominant herself, until she grew sick of fighting and relented. &#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; she told him one night, &#x201c;have a good time.&#x201d; Taken aback by her capitulation, Robert worried about what she was going to do when he got home. He rushed back an hour later. Is that all it takes? Ronnie thought.<br> <br>If Robert&#x2019;s bravado failed to impress his wife, his little brother Jesse saw him as a hero. Jesse, feeling as though he could please their parents only by matching Robert&#x2019;s accomplishments, dropped out of high school in eleventh grade and came to live with Robert and Ronnie in Laredo, where he got a job as a high school security guard. Jesse wanted to become a cop, too, but he was young. Robert advised him to get an associate&#x2019;s degree in criminal justice at Laredo Community College. But Robert hadn&#x2019;t gone to college, and Jesse was eager to start a career. There were openings at the police academy in Uvalde, near Eagle Pass. In the summer of 1997, Robert gave Jesse some money, and his old service weapon, a .357 Magnum. Jesse completed the academy but failed the written test, then failed it again. If he failed a third time...</p><h2>The Chalice of Magdalene: The Search for the Cup That Held the Blood of Christ</h2><p>Reveals the discovery of an artifact that many experts believe may be the Holy Grail <br><br>� Traces the journey of the Grail from the Holy Land to Rome and eventually to a ruined chapel in Shropshire, England <br><br>� Uncovers new evidence identifying the historical King Arthur and his connection to the Holy Grail <br><br>The popular Arthurian stories of the Middle Ages depict the Holy Grail as Christ&#x2019;s cup from the Last Supper, which was believed to have been endowed with miraculous healing powers and the ability to give eternal life to whoever drank from it.

In its field it is the best book ever' Guardian Winner of the Wolfson Prize for history, Reformation: Europe's House Divided 1490-1700 charts a seismic shift in European culture that marked the beginning of the modern world. At a time when men and women were prepared to kill - and be killed - for their faith, the Reformation tore the western world apart. Acclaimed as the definitive account of these epochal events, Diarmaid MacCulloch's history brilliantly re-creates the religious battles of priests, monarchs, scholars and politicians, from the zealous Martin Luther nailing his Theses to the door of a Wittenburg church to the radical Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Jesuit order; from Thomas Cranmer, martyred for his reforms, to the ambitious Philip II, unwavering in his campaign against Europe's 'heretics'. Weaving together the many strands of Reformation and Counter-Reformation, ranging widely across Europe and even to the new world, MacCulloch also reveals as never before how these upheavals affected everyday lives - overturning ideas of love, sex, death and the supernatural, and shaping the modern age. 'Magisterial and eloquent'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;David Starkey 'A triumph of human sympathy'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Blair Worden, Sunday Telegraph 'From politics to witchcraft, from the liturgy to sex; the sweep of European history covered here is breathtakingly panoramic. This is a model work of history'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Noel Malcolm, Sunday Telegraph Books of the Year 'Monumental ... Reformation is set to become a landmark'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lisa Jardine, Observer Diarmaid MacCulloch is Professor of the History of the Church at Oxford University. His Thomas Cranmer won the Whitbread Biography Prize, the James Tait Black Prize and the Duff Cooper Prize. He is also the author of A History of Christianity: The First Three Thousand Years.</p><p>Diarmaid MacCulloch wrote what is widely considered to be the authoritative account of the Reformation&#x2014;a critical juncture in the history of Christianity. "It is impossible to understand modern Europe without understanding these sixteenth-century upheavals in Latin Christianity," he writes. "They represented the greatest fault line to appear in Christian culture since the Latin and Greek halves of the Roman Empire went their separate ways a thousand years before; they produced a house divided." The resulting split between the Catholics and Protestants still divides Christians throughout the Western world. It affects interpretations of the Bible, beliefs about baptisms, and event how much authority is given to religious leaders. The division even fuels an ongoing war. What makes MacCulloch's account rise above previous attempts to interpret the Reformation is the breadth of his research. Rather than limit his narrative to the actions of key theologians and leaders of the era&#x2014;Luther, Zingli, Calvin, Loyola, Cranmer, Henry VIII and numerous popes&#x2014;MacCulloch sweeps his narrative across the culture, politics and lay people of Renaissance Western Europe. This broad brush approach touches upon many fascinating discussions surrounding the Reformation, including his belief that the Latin Church was probably not as "corrupt and ineffective" as Protestants tend to portray it. In fact, he asserts that it "generally satisfied the spiritual needs of the late medieval people." As a historical document, this 750-page narrative has all the key ingredients. MacCulloch, a professor of history as the Church of Oxford University, is an articulate and vibrant writer with a strong guiding intelligence. The structure is sensible&#x2014;starting with the main characters who influenced reforms, then spreading out to the regional concerns, and social intellectual themes of the era. He even fast forwards into American Christianity&#x2014;showing how this historical era influences modern times. MacCulloch is a topnotch historian&#x2014;uncovering material and theories that will seem fresh and inspired to Reformation scholars as well as lay readers. --<i>Gail Hudson</i>Diarmaid MacCulloch is Professor of the History of the Church at Oxford University.

Tolstoy� s genius is seen clearly in the multitude of fully realized and equally memorable characters that populate this massive chronicle. Out of this complex narrative emerges a profound examination of the individual� s place in the historical process, one that makes it clear why Thomas Mann praised Tolstoy for his Homeric powers and placed <b>War and Peace </b>in the same category as the <b>Iliad</b>: � To read him . . . is to find one� s way home . . . to everything within us that is fundamental and sane.�</p><p>"There remains the greatest of all novelists--for what else can we call the author of <b>War and Peace</b>?" <br>--Virginia Woolf<b>A.

"Our bodies are designed to be pain-free through our&nbsp;</b>l<b>ives," says Miranda Esmonde-White, "but to achieve that, we have to move."</b><br>In <i>Forever Painless</i>, Miranda Esmonde-White introduces us to a new understanding of how chronic pain begins when our muscles become unbalanced and cause connective tissue problems. Something as common as daily habits or as unexpected as accidents or injuries create imbalance, and we compensate by favouring our weaker part, leading to strain on our feet, ankles, knees, hips, shoulders, upper back, lower back, elbows, wrists or neck--and eventually such conditions as arthritis, chronic back pain, plantar fasciitis and fibromyalgia. Hips and knees are especially problematic: surgeons often tell those with chronic hip or knee pain to tough it out and come back in two or three years when the damage is sufficiently severe that only a joint replacement will do. <i>Forever Painless </i>deals with preventing and reversing imbalances so you can live a pain-free life. <br><i> Forever Painless</i> will teach you a new way of looking at your body, providing neurological and physiological explanations of the causes of most chronic pain and teaching you simple exercises that real people have used to become free of pain and regain mobility. Among those who have conquered their pain using the techniques in this book: the director of child services in New York City who used these exercises to recover from disabling chronic back pain; an accountant who avoided major bone reconstruction surgery through 20 minutes a day of stretching and strengthening; a prima ballerina whose career was extended by five years when Esmonde-White's exercises relieved her debilitating hip pain. "It's time to change our relationship with chronic pain," Esmonde-White writes. "The solution is right under our noses, it's free, and it doesn't require drugs or surgery: it's gentle rebalancing exercises."</p><p>MIRANDA ESMONDE-WHITE is one of North America's greatest educators on healthy aging and pain-free living. She is best known for her PBS fitness series, <i>Classical Stretch</i>, on-air since 1999 and rated the #1 fitness show on the network. A classically trained ballerina who danced with the National Ballet of Canada, Esmonde-White created the Essentrics technique, which uses low-intensity strengthening and stretching exercises to relieve pain, prevent injury and slenderize and tone the body. Based in Montreal, she works with professional and Olympic athletes and celebrities, and teaches classes to thousands of students worldwide each year. She is the author of <i>Aging Backwards</i>, a <i>New York Times</i> and <i>Globe and Mail</i> bestseller that sparked an award-winning PBS documentary of the same name.

It&#39;s all here -- the good, the bad, the beautiful, the ugly, the unbelievably lucky breaks, and the heartbreaking failures. &#34;Except for my first experience with sex, a major earthquake, and a revolution in which we managed to lose everything we had, life in Cuba was lovely. Exile in Miami was a time for survival, when I perfected many interesting trades such as mobile canary-cage cleaner and broken-mosaic-tile salesman. Father Barry and Al Capone, Jr., helped me finish high school. There I learned much about America and her people while carrying on my battle with her language. &#34;While I was playing guitar and singing at the Roney Plaza in Miami Beach, Xavier Cugat offered me a job with his orchestra. I had to steal from the Waldorf-Astoria kitchen to live on what he paid me. What he taught me was worth a fortune. When I quit and went back to Miami, he sent me a small &#39;Latin&#39; band. When they arrived, I knew I&#39;d been had. In desperation I started beating the hell out of a big Afro-Cuban drum, and the conga was born in the U.S.A. It became a craze and got me all tangled up. Too Many Girls took me to Hollwood and Lucy. After that I decided to forget about too many girls. It was safer. &#34;If you think those first two decades were a little crowded, wait until you read about the next two. I am sure you will understand about the milk girls and the Bingo girls, but Lucy didn&#39;t and filed to divorce Staff Sergeant Arnaz. &#34;You will learn what Lucy and I had to do to convince people we could play husband and wife in I Love Lucy. Shortly afterward Lucie and Desi Jr. were born and our world was paradise. The irony of it all is how our undreamed-of success fame, and fortune turned it into hell. It wasn&#39;t easy to write about all of it, but as my son said, &#39;There&#39;s only one way to do it, Dad. Tell it like it was.&#39;&#34;</p><p></p><h2>This Is the Ultimate Fake Book: It Contains over 1200 Songs for Piano, Organ, Guitar and All &#34;C&#34; Instruments (Hl00240050)</h2><p>This book features over 1200 songs in fake book style.

Such highly successful titles as <i>Death in the Long Grass, Death in the Silent Places, </i>and <i>Death in the Dark Continent </i>have established him as the modern-day master of African adventure writing. Sportsman, adventurer, raconteur par excellence, Capstick has in many ways done for contemporary hunting literature what Hemingway and Robert Ruark did in decades past.<br><br>Until now, Capstick has written post facto about classic hunters of the past and safaris in which he participated as a professional hunter. <i>Peter Capstick's Africa, </i>however, is a very different breed of book: it is the enthralling tale of an entirely new safari, an exciting first-person adventure in which Peter Capstick returns to the long grass for his own dangerous and very personal excursion. The result is a definitive work on African hunting, and one of Peter Capstick's greatest achievements to date.<br><br>In 1985, Capstick went back into the African bush with two top photographers and a crack professional hunter, It was a venture taken for personal challenge, and for the chance to look anew at what had become of the Africa immortalized in his own earlier works. <i>Peter Capstick's Africa </i>is the chronicle, in text and pictures, of this safari. It is full of the same edge-of-the-seat narration, witty anecdotes, and wry observations that have made Capstick's earlier books so popular. But in addition, it tells the story of Africa today as Capstick sees it: a place that is in some ways the same as, but in many different from, the "dark continent" of even a few years ago. The text of the book has been integrated with the photographs of Paul Kimble and Dick van Niekerk into a lavish full-color production that illustrates Capstick's story in a way his fans have never seen before.<br><br><i>Peter Capstick's Africa </i>is a book few lovers of travel and adventure will want to be without. <br></p><p>Peter Hathaway Capstick is the author of many books on hunting, including <i>Safari: The Last Adventure.</i><br>Peter Capstick's Africa<br>PART ONESaile"Through the back of the head," whispered Gordon Cundill in the tiniest of tones.Keeping my eyes locked on the hazy outline of the huge lion, I eased the .375 H&amp;H Magnum to my shoulder. Even through the low setting of the variable scope, his head looked like a small townhouse with excess shrubbery, just a peripheral halo of mane and mass, facing nearly away from me. With an imperceptable <i>snick,</i> I flipped the magnetic scope post into position, held as best I could through the heat waves reflected by the searing Botswana sun that would have staggered a Venetian glass-blower, and leveled at the spot where I reckoned his head met his neck. High, I would take the base of the skull; low, and the spine wouldbe shattered. Either way, a record-book lion for the wall.If I pulled the shot aside on a horizontal angle, however, both Gordon and I knew what would happen.It did.After five and a half days of tracking and two close encounters of the worst kind, I could only see a long, grass-shielded impression of the <i>Tau entunanyana</i> --as he is so pronounced in Tswana--just his head; one ear and the curve of his skull. I knew he was accompanied by a female, with whom he had been doing what came naturally but at a rate and frequency that would astonish any human. (How's about a roll in the hay every twenty minutes? Maybe you, brother, are up to such acrobatics but I have had back problems recently.) I lined up the sights, knowing the 300-grain Winchester Silvertip would have to bull through considerable bush and grass, and aware that a deflection was not only possible but probable. I eased off the trigger of the custom Mauser anyway.That was a major and very nearly fatal error.Whether through bush deflection, lousy shooting (for which I am not especially known), or simple bad luck, the tremendous lion jumped fifteen feet into the air, swapped ends, and came down in what was most certainly our direction. I believe that he charged the sound of the shot, rather than Gordon, Karonda the gun bearer, and me, as our cover was as good as his. With more than five hundred pounds of male lion coming at us as quickly as he could manage, however, the matter was academic and fast becoming immediate. Unfortunately, he had to clear some heavy cover, mostly <i>mopane</i> scrub, before we could take a second whack at him and have, even in African terms, a relatively clear shot.He broke around a clump of <i>mopane</i> some ten yards from where he had been lying with his paramour, in company with two fully grown but nontrophy-sized lions. When I tell you that he charged, I use the term not lightly. He wanted us. Badly. Later, we were to discover one of several good reasons was that he contained a not inconsiderable amount of buckshot in his guts, about the American equivalent of a Double-0. They were old wounds but had still made a clear impression on his future attitude toward humans.As he rounded the clump of bush, you can absolutely bet that I had one thing on my mind: putting as many 300-grain bullets into that bastard as soon as possible and before our acquaintance became any more intimate. I had been knocked down by lions seriously intent on biting me on a couple of previous occasions and was not especially eager to repeat the scenario.I found out later (although I do notremember hearing it at the time, so intense was my concentration in trying to kill the goddamn thing) that he was roaring fit to blow the leaves off the trees and the calluses off your right foot. Lord, but that was one <i>awfully</i> angry lion. (I suppose that had I just caught a .375 Silvertip at the base of the neck, I would have shared his sentiments.)I shall never forget the gleam of his amber and anthracite eyes through the scope when he got into thinner cover only a few yards away. They glistened and glimmered in the hot sun above the crosshairs and post of the Bushnell scope like uncut gems, radioactive orbs centered on one thing:Me.I have no idea why everything tries to eat me. Maybe it's my breath. In any case, this was becoming a rather serious matter, especially when I heard a very strange sound just off to my left: a <i>click,</i> followed after perhaps a second and a half by a tremendous <i>boom!</i> I knew, of course, that it was Gordon firing his .500 Westley Richards Nitro-Express double rifle in a rather fervent attempt to keep the lot of us alive.The only problem was that his ammo was defective and, after four attempts, Gordon had had three hangfires and one complete dud. It was a rifle worth more than a fine sports car (one of three he owns by noted craftsmen/manufacturers), and it had to be just our luck that when our lives were on the absolute line, his big bore--which should have been the precise item required to keep us all paying taxes--failed. Or, to be fair, at least the ammo did.I shifted my sight to adjust to the fact that the lion was coming in at a five-degree angle and smashed a bullet right where it should have counted, smack in the middle of the chest. Okay, I knew that a .375 H&amp;H Silvertip right through the engine room of anything less than a Tyrannosaurus rex was going to have a very negative effect on the chances of your becoming a grandfather. Gordon and Karonda knew the same thing.The lion didn't.He at least swerved at a few yards, and, with a dexterity I thought long gone, I worked the bolt and got a fresh round up the spout. As he turned, I thought, Aha! Gotcha!Wrong again.I have not yet had the chance to examine the skull of that grand beast, but I can tell you with a dozen witnesses, three of whom were on the spot when the incident occurred, that I shot that bloody lion exactly behind the base of the left ear. Precisely what the damage was has not yet been determined, but it sure as hell wasn't enough. He spun and came straight for us--and when a lion does that from a few yards, you had betterhave the ammo belt in the Maxim if you want to see the home airfield again.Gordon's .500 Nitro slapped me again as I heard a peripheral <i>click</i>--<i>boom!</i> Another hangfire!To say that this lion had me highly motivated would be an extreme understatement. There have probably been men who have worked a Mauser bolt-action faster, but I am inclined to at least give myself the benefit of a tie. I claim not the record, but I <i>will</i> tell you that there was a fourth round in my chamber in an astonishing hurry. As the lion continued his spin, I smacked him up the butt in an attempt to smash the pelvic girdle. Although the bullet hole was not more than an inch from his evacuating mechanism, I might as well have missed the bastard completely. It just made him madder and, trust me, he was mad enough to start with after my first shot.I heard the snap of Gordon's striker on the .500 again, but this time there was no report at all. Meanwhile, the bloody thing was damned near on us, so old Karonda, the eighty-year-old Subiya gun bearer, decided to have a go at him with the spare .375 he was carrying. I saw it blow a clump of turf into the air some six feet behind the lion, though he later swore he had shot it through the hips. (There was no such bullet mark, more to our bad luck, as Karonda had once saved Gordon's life from a highly imminent lioness under very similar circumstances.)I believe high-school boys have a term for the position we were now in but it is not for family reading.I was carrying nine cartridges, all 300-grain Silvertips, and had thus far shot that cat twice through the head, once through the chest, and again up the arse. Gordon, through what I consider magnificent shooting, considering his hangfires, had to date placed at least one big soft-point through his guts. It's not the kind of shot that does much to break a lion down but, let's face it, it must be to <i>some</i> degree discouraging.Negative.Having by now clearly seen us, the brute finished his turn and came straight for us. He was one hell of a lot bigger than the lions you see on television, at the circus, or in the zoo, and I want to tell you he was most definitely on a kamikaze mission. I slammed him again in the chest, which, according to all the textbooks as well as my own work and experience, should have cooled him down considerably. This was, however, not a cooperative lion. I don't think he could read.You must understand that all this sort of thing goes on in a matter of seconds--if you're that lucky--and it is pure reflex that keeps you alive or gets you killed with amazing rapidity. You just don'tfool around with wounded, charging, record-book lions. Not very often, you don't.I had now shot him four times, as I said; twice through the noggin, once in the chest, and once more in unspeakable places. Gordon had by that point gotten at least one 570-grain soft-point into him and--it all happened so fast--perhaps a second. (Hitting a running lion at that speed with three hangfires and a dud and connecting with two of the three rounds that actually fired is an amazing feat of marksmanship and shows the kind of, shall we say, intestinal fortitude with which Gordon Cundill is gifted.)I carry a custom Mauser-action, Blin-dee-barreled, bolt-action .375 by theContinental Arms Corporation of New York. I had it made to hold six cartridges. If one loads directly from the action, however, there is always the risk of breaking the extractor, which is precisely what you don't need in the middle of a safari, let alone a lion charge. I therefore carry four rounds in the magazine and one in the chamber with the hammer down. My last shot was in the chamber of the barrel.The lion finished his spin and resumed his charge. Gordon was off to my left and Karonda just to my right. As the beast whirled around, I stuck the last round in the rifle into his shoulder and aimed for his spine. It was the only lousy shot I made, just an inch high. It could have cost us our lives. No two ways: I blew it.My rifle was now empty. Gordon's insurance gun, his dinosaur-stopping .500 Nitro-Express double, didn't work. It very much appeared that my career at the typewriter and the Mauser would both be coming to rather dramatic ends in the next few seconds ... .&nbsp;<br>The tarmac of Jan Smuts Airport turned from coarse pavement to flowing black velvet as our plane gathered speed.

Paul, Fiona, and I were met on the dot by Keith Essen, representing Hunters Africa, who whisked us through Customs despite our guns and the other paraphernalia sometimes queried by authorities in any country.Our final destination was not Zimbabwe, however--where I had spent time in the Matetsi region as a professional hunter during the bush war in the bloody days of the seventies--but Botswana, and this was the easiest route.Curiously, while at Vic Falls Airport, I ran into Eric Wagner, whom we wereshortly to visit. Eric was, at the time, the head of the Safari Club International Conservation Fund. He had, as Fate would have it, acquired the rights to Matetsi Unit #4, precisely my old stamping ground, and promptly invited our party down for a stay, provided the lion Gordon and I were about to assault did not do me first. Fair enough. I accepted, especially when I discovered that Eric had employed Stuart Campbell, my friend of some seventeen years, as his general manager.We drove from Victoria Falls Airport (which I could barely leave with a dry eye, having met so many wonderful friends and clients there in the past) and turned off onto the old hunters' road to Pandamatenga. Our destination was Kasane, in Botswana, where we would take a flight by light aircraft to Saile airfield, only a few hundred yards from Saile Camp.It seemed as if nothing had changed on the old Pandamatenga Road I had traveled so many times before. As Keith Essen expertly maneuvered us along, I even recognized individual trees. We had, however, a slight problem looming ahead.Not many hours before, the South African Defence Force had carried out a preemptive strike against several strongholds harboring African National Congress terrorists in the capital city of Gaberone, way to the south. Now two of my party were holding South African passports, and I was wondering if there would be an international incident at Kasane that could possibly sabotage my safari plans.I think that what is about to come is technically called a digression, but I shall do my best to deliver it accurately. Should you be going on safari, I hope you will take it as gospel. Africa today is not that of Robert Ruark in the early days. To highly (but not inaccurately) simplify matters, it seems there is now just one element that matters, especially in so-called emerging nations: <i>power!</i> Individually or on any other basis, it is the cornerstone of all black African society. When you enter Customs, as I shall vividly demonstrate later in this book, you may or may not understand precisely what I am saying but you will soon catch on. My observations are not intended as racial slurs but, as I have said in previous works, are a function of culture and of my personal experience.The immense majority of Customs and Immigration officials are charmingly helpful in most emerging black African countries, especially those I visited for the purposes of this book. One does, however, run across the "new man" who is most anxious to obtain promotion byputting somebody in jail. That was bloody nearly me, and I have a low threshold for incarceration, especially in countries where the man on the street doesn't do very well feeding himself, let alone the poor bugger in the slammer. Spare me Third World slammers ... .With all this chasing through my mind. we were promptly and without incident delivered at Kasane, which is the border post between Zimbabwe and Botswana in the far northeast of Botswana. I was sweating blood as well as more urgent juices as we approached the tiny concrete-and-corrugated-steel hut that housed the formalities of Customs.No problem. My American passport as well as the South African documents were hardly glanced at. Honestly, in retrospect, I don't think that word of the strike on parts of Gaberone had reached Kasane yet.After a brief stop at the Hunters Africa office in Kasane, we were then driven to the airstrip, accompanied by Peter Hepburn, Hunters Africa's manager there. Our pilot, a Frenchman called Luc, was already on hand, and it was less than an hour later that we landed as smoothly as pancake batter at the airstrip close to Saile Camp after a delightful flight in perfect weather.Gordon was there in person to meet us, along with his entire African safari staff --the damndest collection of charm and talent I've ever run across. Well, that's Gordon. If you're not the best, you don't work for him. Not for long you don't.If you have spent any time in Africa, you may flatter yourself that you have a feeling for the people of the more remote tribes. In my case, considering the years I have spent in several African countries, my self-flattery is probably accurate. I have always had a rather indefinable affinity for the men I worked with, especial...</p><h2>John Quincy Adams: American Visionary</h2><p><p>Fred Kaplan, the acclaimed, award-winning author of <em>Lincoln,</em> returns with <em>John Quincy Adams</em>, an illuminating biography of one of the most overlooked presidents in American history&#x2014;a leader of sweeping perspective whose progressive values helped shape the course of the nation.</p><p>In this fresh and lively biography rich in literary analysis and new historical detail, Fred Kaplan brings into focus the dramatic life of John Quincy Adams&#x2014;the little known and much misunderstood sixth president of the United States and the first son of John and Abigail Adams&#x2014;and persuasively demonstrates how Adams's inspiring, progressive vision guided his life and helped shape the course of America.</p><p>Kaplan draws on a trove of unpublished archival material to trace Adams's evolution from his childhood during the Revolutionary War to his brilliant years as Secretary of State to his time in the White House and beyond.

Police chief Jeffrey Tolliver then finds a second victim crucified and recognises the work of a serial killer.</p><p>In <i>Blindsighted</i> (book one of an anticipated three featuring Grant County, Georgia, pediatrician and coroner Dr. Sara Linton), first-time novelist Karin Slaughter comes out swinging in true medical examiner fashion. That is to say, covered with blood from the get-go. <p> </p><blockquote> Without warning, the body jerked violently, pitching forward and slamming Sara onto the floor. Blood spread out around both of them, and Sara instinctively clawed to get out from under the convulsing woman. With her feet and hands she groped for some kind of purchase on the slick bathroom floor. Finally, Sara managed to slide out from underneath her. She turned Sibyl over, cradling her head, trying to help her through the convulsions. Suddenly, the jerking stopped. </blockquote><p> Sibyl is, or was, Sibyl Adams, a college professor who had the misfortune of being drugged, savagely raped, slashed, and left for dead in the toilet of the local diner, to be coincidentally discovered by Sara Linton. Coincidences don't stop there, and neither do the rapes and murders. The next is, unimaginably, still more gruesome than the first and it, too, is discovered by Dr. Linton. Police Chief Jeffrey Tolliver is Sara's ex-husband, and mercurial detective Lena Adams, another major player in the ensuing drama, was Sibyl's twin sister. </p><p> And the monster behind these increasingly more depraved acts? Suspects abound, from the diner's jack-of-all-trades, Will Harris, to Victim No. 2's boyfriend, to Jack Allen Wright who, a dozen years prior, raped Dr. Linton (that rape had been a secret until now). There are other possibilities, naturally, and it soon becomes apparent that Sara's an intended target.</p><p> A graduate of the Patricia Cornwell school of mayhem and gore, Slaughter has faithfully stitched together a fast, engaging, and diverting read complete with a strong-yet-vulnerable heroine. Characters are nicely if somewhat obviously drawn, the plot is inventive, and the narrative's pacing quickens the pulse straight to the cliff-hanging denouement.

Centennial Award for 100th published novel.<br><br><em>Sunday afternoon&#x2014;Bordelaise, Louisiana</em><br><br>A storm was brewing, and Nick Aroyo could tell, even from inside the Bordelaise Police Department, that it was going to be a strong one. The day had begun with sunshine and a breeze, but for the past couple of hours the wind had continued to rise, until now it had elevated to a high-pitched whine that he could hear through the three-foot-thick concrete block walls of his jail cell.<br><br>For Nick, jail was the last damn place he needed to be, but getting arrested on a Friday night in Bordelaise, Louisiana, meant you awaited the judge's pleasure when it came to a "prompt" arraignment, and for whatever reason, this time it wasn't happening until Monday.<br><br>In his other life, away from the undercover world of the DEA, Sunday meant sleeping in, hot wings and watching football on TV. But there would be none of that today. The jailer had yet to pick up their food trays from lunch, and the cockroach crawling on top of his leftover macaroni and cheese was so damn big he was afraid to turn his back on it. As for sleeping, at four inches over six feet tall, there was no way Nick could get comfortable on a jail bunk. So he paced, thinking about the three other men he'd been running with for the past eight months and who'd been arrested with him, and trying not to think of the luxurious extra-long mattress back in his Miami condo. Even though he knew his mother was keeping an eye on his place, he was anxious to put this case behind him and go home.<br><br>There had been a time when he'd thrived on undercover work, but the older he got, the more he realized that real life was passing him by. He had yet to have one serious relationship survive his unexplained absences, and at thirty-six, his own biological clock was ticking. He wanted someone to come home to and a kid who called him Daddy.<br><br>Suddenly he became aware that the wind outside had changed to a roar and a siren was going off somewhere, and when something hit the roof of the jail with such force that he felt the vibration beneath his feet, he ducked. To his horror, seconds later the corner of the roof began to lift. Knowing he only had moments to take cover, he grabbed his mattress, hit the floor, then slid beneath the frame of his bunk, pulling the mattress in on top of him.<br><br>The sounds that followed were like something out of a nightmare. The air became a living, breathing banshee&#x2014;screaming nonstop and ripping the roof and rafters from above him before sucking them up into its vortex.<br><br>He clutched the mattress against him, then closed his eyes as he began to be pelted by rain and f lying debris. Suddenly something hit the bottom of his boot with such force that his entire body slid a foot to the north.<br><br>Above the wind, he could hear a scream and thought it was Wayman French, one of the men with whom he'd been arrested. Then the winds ripped the mattress from his grasp, pulled him out from under the bunk and slammed him against the front of the jail cell. Before he could get a grip on the bars, his body went flying backward, slamming up against a wall; then he was turned around and slammed back against the bars. Realizing he'd just been handed a second chance, he locked his arms through the bars and ducked his head, trying to protect his face and eyes from the rain and wind-whipped debris. The last thing he was thinking was that his mother would have to identify his body; then something hit the back of his head and everything went black.<br><br>When Nick came to he was laying on his back, looking up at the sky, rain pelting his face. The roof was gone, as was the back wall of his cell.<br><br>His first thought was to make a run for it. He needed to contact his boss, Stewart Babcock, the deputy chief of the DEA, and tell him where he'd hidden eight months worth of intel. It would suck to have spent the last months of his life in the underbelly of society and then die before he could turn over the goods. The info was comprehensive&#x2014;from the lowest of runners all the way to the top man in the drug ring&#x2014;and it mattered too much for him to lose it.<br><br>Nick staggered to his feet, slipping once on the rain-slicked floor before he finally gained steady footing. A quick body check revealed he was bleeding in several places, although nothing that appeared deep or serious. There was a knot on the back of his head and it hurt to breathe, but he'd didn't think any ribs were broken. After a quick scan of the alley behind the jail, he crawled out over the rubble that had been the back wall and started moving, looking to see if the other three men were alive.<br><br>Lou Drake was the first to climb out to meet him&#x2014;a stocky, bald-headed man of average height and less than average intelligence, and vicious without thought. He was wild-eyed and bleeding but obviously mobile, as he jumped over a hunk of drywall and clapped Nick on the back.<br><br>"Damn! Can you believe we lived through that? Let's make a run for it before someone comes looking to see what happened."<br><br>"What about Tug and Wayman?" Nick asked.<br><br>Lou shrugged as if the French brothers were no longer his concern, then frowned when Nick climbed back into the building.<br><br>"Fuck it," he said. "It's every man for himself."<br><br>Nick turned. "Then run, damn it. If they're still breathing, I'm not leaving them behind."<br><br>Lou cursed but knew enough to realize he would need more than his street smarts to get through the backwaters of Louisiana. He was originally from Detroit. His comfort zone was the streets, not alligator-infested swamps.<br><br>Wayman French was conscious, but pinned beneath debris. He could hear the others talking and was already calling for help. When he saw Nick climbing toward him over a pile of concrete blocks and rafters, he started waving his arms.<br><br>"My leg! I'm caught!" he said urgently, pointing to the piece of rafter that had fallen on top of the bunk where he'd been lying, pinning him to it.<br><br>Nick pointed at Lou. "Get in here and help me!" he said, and together, they began moving rubble, sliding around in the rain, until Way was free.<br><br>Way rolled out of the bunk onto his knees, then pushed himself up from the rain-soaked, debris-strewn floor.<br><br>"Thanks, man," he said, and then started looking for his brother, who'd been in the next cell. "Tug! Tug! Oh, damn, I don't see him!"<br><br>Lightning snaked across the sky, followed by a loud rumble of thunder, as Nick crawled over into the next cell and began digging through the rubble. Tug French was the undisputed leader of their gang, but he was nowhere in sight.<br><br>Way's panic increased as he started to sob. "The twister...the twister...it musta' took him."<br><br>Then they heard a moan and saw a hand slide out from beneath a chunk of drywall. They scrambled forward, their movements frantic as they began removing rubble, knowing that with each passing second, their chances of escape were lessening.<br><br>When they heard the first siren, Nick's hopes fell. They were going to get arrested again before they even got off the block. He could, of course, confess his identity to the locals, but it would end his career as an undercover operative, plus, if word got out before his boss got the information, the possibility existed that the big dogs could make a getaway, and they were the ones Babcock wanted most.<br><br>The sirens set Lou off. He began to curse. "The longer we wait, the more certain we're gonna get caught!"<br><br>Wayman French was large in size and a little slow in the head, but the thought of leaving his big brother behind wasn't on the table. He grabbed Lou by the throat with one hand and started squeezing&#x2014;just enough to remind the other man that he could still die today.<br><br>"You help get Tug free or I will break your fuckin' neck," Wayman said.<br><br>"Both of you! Shut up!" Nick said urgently. "Someone's gonna hear the noise. Lou! Grab the end of that rafter. Way, you grab Tug's shoulders. When I say so, you drag him out from under this, okay?"<br><br>Way gave Lou a last glaring look, then slid his hands beneath Tug's arms and waited. Nick and Lou grabbed opposite ends of the rafter.<br><br>"Okay, Lou. On three." Nick began the countdown. "One. Two. Three. Lift!"<br><br>They gripped and lifted in unison, putting every ounce of their strength into the effort&#x2014;and the rafter moved&#x2014;just enough.<br><br>Suddenly Tug was free.<br><br>Way swung him up into his arms, then threw him over his shoulder and started climbing out of the demolished jail. Nick and Lou followed.<br><br>The rain had become a downpour, and they could hear sirens as they ran&#x2014;an indication that the rescue efforts had begun. Way was limping but showed no signs of stopping. Tug was bleeding profusely from the head, but the rain would wash away the blood along with their tracks. What they needed was a car and something to wear besides jail-bait orange if they were going to have any chance of making a getaway.<br><br>Just as they turned a corner, Nick saw that the department store across the street had taken a direct hit, and that most of the front of the building was missing.<br><br>"In there!" he shouted, and darted across the street and into the store with the others right behind him.<br><br>The once neat shelves had been emptied of goods and the racks of clothing strewn about in chaotic abandon by the force of the wind. They began combing through the jumble, looking for something in their sizes.<br><br>Nick was relieved to find jeans long enough to fit and quickly changed, ripping tags off the pants and a T-shirt before putting them on.<br><br>Tug had regained consciousness. He was groggy and in obvious pain, but he knew enough to get out of his prison garb. When Wayman found a pair of jeans and a shirt in Tug's size, Tug put them on. As Lou began to change, he tossed his prison uniform on the floor in plain sight.<br><br>"Hide it," Nick said, pointing to the neon orange jumpsuit Lou had just abandoned.<br><br>Lou shoved them in among the rest of the debris just as Tug staggered and slumped against a table. Wayman grabbed him, frantically trying to rouse his brother.<br><br>"Tug! Tug! Are you all right?"<br><br>"He needs a doctor," Nick said.<br><br>"Hell, no," Tug muttered. "No doctor."<br><br>Nick swore beneath his breath. "It's your funeral," he said, then grabbed a package of men's undershirts, tore them open, ripped one into strips and bandaged the open wound on Tug's head.<br><br>"That'll slow the bleeding down, but it won't fix what's wrong," he said.<br><br>Tug pushed away his hand. "Let's just get out of here."<br><br>Moments later they were back on the street, minus their prison garb but still afoot.<br><br>Nick's ribs were getting sorer by the minute, Wayman was definitely dragging his right leg, and Nick could tell by the way Tug was moving that he was about to pass out again. They needed a ride.<br><br>All of a sudden an ambulance shot across the intersection in front of them. Nick stopped, then held his breath, certain they would be seen, but the driver never even looked their way. As soon as it passed, Nick made a decision.<br><br>"Way, take Tug into that alley and stay out of sight. Lou and I will find wheels and come back for you."<br><br>"Hell, no!" Wayman said. "We don't split up."<br><br>"They'll be looking for four men, not two," Nick said. "And Tug's about to pass out. I won't leave you. I swear."<br><br>Wayman wavered. He glanced meaningfully at Lou and then back at Nick. "<em>He </em>would."<br><br>Nick put a hand on Wayman's arm. "He's free to go anywhere he wants. But I don't run with Drake. Tug's the boss. I'll be back."<br><br>Wayman took a deep breath, eyeing the expression on Nick Aroyo's face, then finally nodded.<br><br>"Yeah...okay, but hurry."<br><br>"As fast as I can," Nick said. "Just stay out of sight and stay put."<br><br>Wayman led his brother into the alley as Nick and Lou dashed across the street.<br><br>"Smooth move," Lou said as they continued to run, dodging downed power lines, broken glass and miscellaneous debris.<br><br>"It wasn't a move. I meant what I said," Nick said.<br><br>Lou glared "Then you're a fool, taking a chance on getting caught for them. They wouldn't do the same for you."<br><br>"I walk my own path," Nick said. "So...either you're part of the problem&#x2014;in which case, beat it&#x2014;or you're part of the solution, in which case keep an eye out for a pharmacy and wheels big enough for all four of us."<br><br>"Pharmacy? What the hell for?"<br><br>"Tug needs first aid."<br><br>Lou cursed beneath his breath, muttering something about ass-kissing and do-gooder.<br><br>Nick ignored him as they ran, making sure to stay out of sight of the growing number of rescue vehicles. When they finally found the drugstore, a tree from the town square had been driven through the plate glass windows and the door was standing ajar.<br><br>"Time for a little shopping," Nick said, and darted into the doorway, past the limbs and broken glass. He grabbed a large sack from behind the checkout stand and handed another one to Lou. "Get bottles of water and food...crackers, energy bars...candy bars...what-ever you can find."<br><br>Lou headed toward the cooler on the west wall, while Nick started down the aisles, looking for first aid. The window between the pharmacy and the rest of the store had been shattered. He vaulted over the counter, scanning the shelves until he found antibiotics and painkillers, then headed back to the front, grabbing gauze, surgical tape and alcohol. After making sure no one was in sight, he and Lou slipped out of the store and bolted across the street.<br><br>They walked up on an older model Lincoln one block over. The doors of the big white car weren't locked, and when Nick slid in behind the steering wheel and pulled down the visor, a set of keys dropped into his lap.<br><br>Lou chortled as he jumped in beside him. "I love me some stupid, small-town hicks!"<br><br>Nick thrust the key in the ignition.<br><br></p><h2>O Pioneers!

Weaving science, social history, and personal narrative to tell us the story of one of the most important conceptual breakthroughs of modern times, Mukherjee animates the quest to understand human heredity and its surprising influence on our lives, personalities, identities, fates, and choices. <br>Throughout the narrative, the story of Mukherjee s own family with its tragic and bewildering history of mental illness cuts like a bright, red line, reminding us of the many questions that hang over our ability to translate the science of genetics from the laboratory to the real world. In superb prose and with an instinct for the dramatic scene, he describes the centuries of research and experimentation from Aristotle and Pythagoras to Mendel and Darwin, from Boveri and Thomas Morgan to Crick, Watson and Rosa Franklin, all the way through the revolutionary twenty-first century innovators who mapped the human genome. <br>As "The" "New Yorker "said of" The Emperor of All Maladies," It s hard to think of many books for a general audience that have rendered any area of modern science and technology with such intelligence, accessibility, and compassion An extraordinary achievement. Riveting, revelatory, and magisterial history of a scientific idea coming to life, and an essential preparation for the moral complexity introduced by our ability to create or write the human genome, "The Gene" is a must-read for everyone concerned about the definition and future of humanity. This is the most crucial science of our time, intimately explained by a master."</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of May 2016:</strong> In 2010, Siddhartha Mukherjee was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for his book <em>The Emperor of All Maladies</em>, a &#x201c;biography&#x201d; of cancer. Here, he follows up with a biography of the gene&#x2014;and <em>The Gene</em> is just as informative, wise, and well-written as that first book. Mukherjee opens with a survey of how the gene first came to be conceptualized and understood, taking us through the thoughts of Aristotle, Darwin, Mendel, Thomas Morgan, and others; he finishes the section with a look at the case of Carrie Buck (to whom the book is dedicated), who eventually was sterilized in 1927 in a famous American eugenics case. Carrie Buck&#x2019;s sterilization comes as a warning that informs the rest of the book. This is what can happen when we start tinkering with this most personal science and misunderstand the ethical implications of those tinkerings. Through the rest of <em>The Gene</em>, Mukherjee clearly and skillfully illustrates how the science has grown so much more advanced and complicated since the 1920s&#x2014;we are developing the capacity to directly manipulate the human genome&#x2014;and how the ethical questions have also grown much more complicated.

To write about boxing is to write about oneself--however elliptically, and unintentionally. And to write about boxing is to be forced to contemplate not only boxing, but the perimeters of civilization--what it is, or should be, to be 'human' . . . </p><p>The sport seems in crisis, its best practitioners no less than its most dubious contaminate by association with fixed fights, manipulated judges, questionable referees. Demands for its abolition are made, indignation is aroused, well-argued editorials are printed, deals continue to be made, boxers continue to be , managed.' occasionally there is a boxing match that, in its demonstration of skill, courage, intelligence, hope, seems to redeem the sport--or almost. Perhaps boxing has always been in crisis a sport <em>of</em> crisis.</p><p>Without doubt, it is our most dramatically 'masculine' sport, and our most dramatically 'self-destructive' sport. In this, for some for us, its abiding interest lies."</p><p>--Joyce Carol Oates,<br>from the Foreword</p></p><p>Yes, the same Joyce Carol Oates who packs one of the most lethal punches in American literature also happens to be an astute observer of the sweet science. Oates filters her knockout collection of essays through multifaceted prisms of art, history, sexuality, and politics to directly confront and explore boxing's physical and commercial brutality, but also the sense of human struggle and survival that's at boxing's purest core. "In the boxing ring," she writes, "man is <i>in extremis,</i> performing an atavistic rite ... for the mysterious solace of those who can participate only vicariously in such drama: the drama of life in the flesh. Boxing has become America's tragic theater." And from her ringside perspective, Oates, a true heavyweight of letters, analyzes the performances just brilliantly.<p>Joyce Carol Oates is a recipient of the National Medal of Humanities, the National Book Critics Circle Ivan Sandrof Lifetime Achievement Award, the National Book Award, and the PEN/Malamud Award for Excellence in Short Fiction, and has been nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. She has written some of the most enduring fiction of our time, including <em>We Were the Mulvaneys</em>; <em>Blonde</em>, which was nominated for the National Book Award; and the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>The Accursed</em>.

Previously he has been a New York-based financial reporter for <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> and a London and Frankfurt correspondent of the <i>International Herald Tribune.</i> <br> <br> <b>Bob Brewer</b> is a U.S. Navy Vietnam War veteran who grew up in Hatfield, Arkansas. Since retiring from the Navy, he has returned to Arkansas to devote his time to investigating the mysteries of the Knights of the Golden Circle.Conspiracy connoisseurs tired of contemplating whether Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone will feast on this tale of the 19th-century doings of the Knights of the Golden Circle. According to treasure hunter Brewer (aided by Bloomberg News editor-at-large Getler), who attempts to unravel their secrets in hopes of finding millions of dollars of hidden gold, the KGC was a sinister group of influential Southerners intent on engineering the secession of Southern states. They supposedly conspired to split the 1860 Democratic convention so that a weak candidate would emerge, guaranteeing Lincoln's election and support for secession-a deep game indeed. Losing the Civil War sent them underground, where, the authors say, political theorist and KGC member Jesse James, whose death they faked, led them to amass a fortune primarily through the pedestrian crimes of bank and stagecoach robbery and, more creatively, by collecting a multimillion-dollar award from Mexican Emperor Maximilian as repayment for aiding Maximilian's tottering regime. They hid their treasure, preserving knowledge of its whereabouts through a series of devilishly complex symbols known only to initiates for the day the South would rise again. Brewer believes some of his relatives were "sentinels" charged with protecting the KGC's hidden treasure. As fanciful as the group's history sounds (and the authors admit it is heavily based on circumstantial evidence), Brewer is convincing that the code existed and that he deciphered some of it, and his treasure hunting meets with modest success. In the end, this is a curiosity that will strain many readers' credibility, but leave a lingering "Maybe."

The first shall fear me; the second shall long to behold me. The year is 1806, and centuries have passed since practical magic faded into England&#39;s past. But scholars of its glorious history discover that one magician remains: the reclusive Mr Norrell, whose talent sends a thrill through the country. Yet the cautious, fussy Norrell is challenged by the emergence of another magician: the brilliant novice Jonathan Strange. Young, handsome and daring, Strange is the very antithesis of Norrell. And so begins a dangerous and dazzling battle between these two great men that will lead them into wars, personal battles, and places they should not have dared to enter.</p><p>It's 1808 and that Corsican upstart Napoleon is battering the English army and navy. Enter Mr. Norrell, a fusty but ambitious scholar from the Yorkshire countryside and the first practical magician in hundreds of years. What better way to demonstrate his revival of British magic than to change the course of the Napoleonic wars? Susanna Clarke's ingenious first novel, <i>Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr. Norrell</i>, has the cleverness and lightness of touch of the Harry Potter series, but is less a fairy tale of good versus evil than a fantastic comedy of manners, complete with elaborate false footnotes, occasional period spellings, and a dense, lively mythology teeming beneath the narrative. Mr. Norrell moves to London to establish his influence in government circles, devising such powerful illusions as an 11-day blockade of French ports by English ships fabricated from rainwater. But however skillful his magic, his vanity provides an Achilles heel, and the differing ambitions of his more glamorous apprentice, Jonathan Strange, threaten to topple all that Mr. Norrell has achieved. A sparkling debut from Susanna Clarke--and it's not all fairy dust. <i>--Regina Marler</i><p>BOOK SENSE BOOK OF THE YEAR<br>A <i>PEOPLE </i>MAGAZINE "TOP TEN" BOOK<br>WINNER OF THE HUGO AWARD<br>WINNER OF THE WORLD FANTASY AWARD</p><p>"Ravishing...Combines the dark mythology of fantasy with the delicious social comedy of Jane Austen into a masterpiece of the genre that rivals Tolkien."&#x2015;<i>Time</i></p><p>At the dawn of the nineteenth century, two very different magicians emerge to change England's history.

He becomes Norrell's student, and they join forces in the war against France. But Strange is increasingly drawn to the wildest, most perilous forms of magic, straining his partnership with Norrell, and putting at risk everything else he holds dear.</p><p>"What kind of magic can make an 800-page novel seem too short?

But whenever James and his family drove to New York City to visit Uncle Andy, they got to see how "junk" could become something truly amazing in an artist's hands.<br><br><b>Uncle Andy's</b> offers an exciting and unique perspective on one of the most influential artists of our time. Through James' eyes, we see the things that made his family visits memorable-including the wonderful disarray of Andy's house, waking up surrounded by important art and incredible collected objects, trying on Andy's wigs, sharing the run of Andy's house with his twenty-five cats (all named Sam), and getting art supplies from Andy as a goodbye present. James was lucky enough to learn about art from an innovative master and he shows how these visits with Uncle Andy taught him about the creative process and inspired him to become an artist.</p><p>James Warhola wrote and illustrated <i>Uncle Andy&#x2019;s</i>: A faabbbulous visit with<i>Andy Warhol,</i> a Book Sense 76 selection.

He lives in Tivoli, New York.Grade 1-4-Warhola, nephew of the artist Andy Warhol (who dropped the "a" from his last name early in his career), recounts his family's relationship with his famous uncle. Several times a year, he, his siblings, and his parents surprised Andy and his mother with a visit to their home in New York City. Warhol's house, always crammed with all kinds of things, including 25 cats, was a giant playground for the children. But the author's mother considered the place an untamed mess. To her "Gee, Andy, when you going to get rid of this stuff?" he countered, "Ohhh, no. This is art." And indeed, Warhola's text reiterates the theme that art is everywhere, a truth that his mother comes to realize in the end. The large watercolor illustrations usher readers into the New York City of the '60s, the streets crowded with tail-finned cars, the Automat and RKO Palace among the buildings lining the sidewalks, and a store window advertising pork chops for $.39 a pound. Boxes of Campbell's soup, paintings of Marilyn Monroe, Elvis, and other stars, and many other objects that eventually found their way into Warhol's art abound throughout his house, and a cutaway view of all five floors, with cats peeping out everywhere, will hold readers' interest. In spite of the artist's eccentricities, among them his wigs and his cats, the author's evident admiration for the man who invigorated his own artistic talent shines in this story.

She now works in Amsterdam as a children's book illustrator.</p><p>"In their second case (<em>Detective Gordon: The First Case</em>, rev. 5/15), Detective Gordon (an elderly toad feeling his age) and Police Assistant Buffy (a young mouse determined to prove herself) face the issue of bullying. Someone has been saying 'nasty things' to fellow forest creatures. The victims are too afraid to identify the culprit, so Gordon and Buffy investigate&#x2015;not only who is doing the bullying, but why. The truth of the situation is, indeed, more complicated than it first appears, and as before, Gordon and Buffy's application of the law is just and compassionate. During the investigation, Gordon contemplates the distinctions between intentional nastiness, accidental 'un-nice'-ness, and thoughtlessness, and the partners 'fess up to occasional unkindness' of their own. 'Police must always tell the truth,' after all, and 'must always investigate themselves.' <strong>Text and illustrations alike are full of humor and affection, making for a thoughtful but light-handed exploration of the topic.</strong> By case's end Buffy has earned a promotion (and learned to read) and Gordon has embarked on a much-needed vacation, leaving things in Buffy's capable paws. <strong>Loose black line drawings with washes of warm color portray the friends, their cozy home, and the forest community they serve and protect.</strong>"&#x2015;<em>The Horn Book Magazine</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Detective Gordon is a pudgy toad with a strong penchant for cakes and a predilection for naps. Luckily for all involved, his assistant Buffy, an energetic and kind-hearted mouse, is always by his side and ready to work. When Buffy discovers that not everyone in the forest is happy and, indeed, some have become 'sad and serious,' the two set off to investigate. As they interview various witnesses, such as a weepy crow and a depressed rabbit, the two realize that someone is being intentionally cruel, and this constitutes a major crime for these gentle creatures. In order to solve the case, Buffy and Gordon must brave some of their own fears to figure out who is spreading gloom throughout the land. Once again, Nilsson (<em>Detective Gordon: The First Case</em>, [Gecko, 2015]) delivers a rare gem of a book with age-appropriate content for precocious young readers. <strong>Full of droll asides and an emphasis on the importance of kindness, this is also an excellent read-aloud selection for classrooms or families.</strong> Spee's charming illustrations add just the right feel to the gentle tone of the text, which is translated from the original Swedish. While it is optimal if kids have the read the first book, it certainly is not necessary.

Detective Gordon, a toad, wakes to find the morning cake tin, the afternoon cake tin, and the evening cake tin all missing. Oh no!

The police force investigates. No one will name the culprit, but it turns out there's some teasing going on. Careful detective work exposes the bully. However, the case is far from cut and dry. Good thing they have the Book of Law to remind them what's forbidden, though Buffy must first learn to read in order to consult it on her own.

The first book in the series, <i>Aunt Dimity's Death</i>, was voted "One of the Century's 100 Favorite Mysteries" by the Independent Mystery Booksellers Association. She lives in Colorado Springs, Colorado.One<br><br> Annabelle Craven was an ideal neighbor. Quiet, tidy, and unfailingly polite, she was the sort of neighbor who could be relied upon to lend a frantic baker a cup of sugar or to water a window box while its owner was away on holiday.<br><br> No one knew Mrs. Craven's exact age. She never mentioned it, and it would have been impertinent to inquire, but anyone with eyes could see that she was elderly. Her tweed skirts and blazers hung loosely on her shrunken frame, her soft gray eyes peered out from a face webbed with wrinkles, and she wore her long white hair in a wispy bun on the back of her head. Her tweed skirts and blazers were elderly, too, as were her sensible shoes, but her clothes were well made and well kept and would in all likelihood outlast her.<br><br> Mrs. Craven was in remarkably good health for a woman of her advanced years. Her eyesight was undimmed, her hearing was excellent, and her nimble fingers could undo knots that defeated much younger women. She moved slowly but surely, without the aid of a cane or a walker, and everyone who knew her agreed that her mind was as agile as her fingers. She could hold her own in any conversation and she wasn't the least bit forgetful. If Mrs. Craven made an appointment, she kept it.<br><br> Mrs. Craven lived in Finch, a small and somnolent village set among the rolling hills and the patchwork fields of the Cotswolds, a pastoral haven described in countless guidebooks as one of the prettiest regions in England.<br><br> I agreed with the guidebooks. My family and I lived near Finch, in a honey-colored cottage on a narrow winding lane lined with tall hedgerows. Although my husband, Bill, and I were Americans, as were our twin sons and our daughter, we'd lived in England long enough to develop a minor addiction to scones, clotted cream, and strawberry jam.<br><br> We kept our addiction in check by leading full and busy lives. Bill ran the European branch of his family's venerable Boston law firm from an office overlooking the village green; our ten-year-old sons, Will and Rob, attended Morningside School in the nearby market town of Upper Deeping; and I juggled the challenging roles of wife, mother, friend, neighbor, community volunteer, and chief baby wrangler.<br><br> Our daughter, Bess, was thirteen months old and terrifyingly mobile. She kept me on my toes by toddling eagerly toward anything that might kill her. Her death wish list included, but was by no means limited to, stairs, stoves, streams, snakes, wasps, and well-sharpened knives.<br><br> The sixth member of our family was Stanley, a sleek black cat with dandelion-yellow eyes. Stanley had a decided preference for Bill, though he was kind enough to tolerate the rest of us. He divided his time between sleeping in Bill's favorite armchair and keeping his long, curling tail out of Bess's reach.<br><br> Bill's father, William Willis, Sr., had made our happiness complete when he'd retired from his position as the head of the family firm and moved to England to be near his grandchildren. A genteel and well-heeled widower, Willis, Sr., had broken many a hopeful heart in Finch when he'd married the noted watercolorist Amelia Bowen. The newlyweds lived just outside of Finch, in Fairworth House, a graceful Georgian mansion surrounded by a modest estate.<br><br> Mrs. Craven lived in Bluebell Cottage, a tiny gem in the necklace of golden-hued stone buildings that encircled the village green. She'd moved into her small cottage a few years after Bill and I had moved into our somewhat larger one, and I'm ashamed to say that I wasn't on hand to greet her when she arrived. I'd been toilet training the twins at the time&#x2014;an exercise guaranteed to concentrate the mind&#x2014;and I'd been too preoccupied with Making Toilet Time Fun to spare a thought for an elderly newcomer.<br><br> I'd spared many thoughts for Mrs. Craven since then. I paused to chat with her whenever our paths crossed, and they crossed almost daily. Like the rest of our neighbors, Mrs. Craven and I took tea breaks in Sally Cook's tearoom; joined in the weekly sing-alongs at Peacock's pub; attended services at St. George's Church; and shopped at Taxman's Emporium, Finch's grandly named general store.<br><br> I could also count on seeing Mrs. Craven at the many villagewide events that kept Finch from becoming too somnolent. Nothing, not even the changeable English weather, could keep her away from the flower show, the art show, the church fete, and the harvest festival, and she always arrived in plenty of time to snag a front-row seat at the Nativity play. She was famous in Finch for using a pair of antique opera glasses to view the annual sheepdog trials and she seemed to take a great deal of pleasure in watching my horse-mad sons and their friends compete for ribbons in the local gymkhana.<br><br> Mrs. Craven had no children of her own and no close relatives. She'd outlived most of her friends and she'd lost her beloved husband to the ravages of Alzheimer's disease. She'd once told me that his lengthy decline and his final passing had prompted her to leave her old village behind and to make a fresh start in a place untainted by painful memories. I'd told her that she'd chosen her new home well.<br><br> Everyone in Finch liked Mrs. Craven. Though she didn't own a car, someone could always be found to take her to Upper Deeping to do her banking, to see her doctor, or to hunt for bargains at the Saturday sales. Sally Cook never tired of swapping recipes with her, Dick Peacock named one of his undrinkable homemade cordials after her, and George Wetherhead, the most bashful man in Finch, was relaxed enough in her presence to meet her gaze when they exchanged pleasantries. Mr. Barlow, who served as our local handyman as well as the church sexton, looked after her cottage free of charge, and James Hobson, a retired schoolteacher and an enthusiastic amateur historian, loved to listen to her stories about "the olden days."<br><br> Mrs. Craven could have spent every minute of every day in what passed for a social whirl in Finch, but she chose to spend much of her time alone in Bluebell Cottage, pursuing her primary passion: making quilts. She'd turned her sunny upstairs front bedroom into a workroom, but it wasn't the only room she'd dedicated to her craft. She'd lined the dining room, the lumber room, the attic, and the back bedroom with shelves built to her specifications by Mr. Barlow to hold row upon row of clear plastic boxes in which she stored what appeared to be a lifetime's accumulation of vintage fabrics.<br><br> Though she kept her best china in a handsome mahogany sideboard in the dining room, she used the equally handsome mahogany table as a work surface. I'd often seen a quilt's three layers&#x2014;backing, batting, and top&#x2014;spread one atop the other on the dining room table, awaiting the next phase in production.<br><br> The dining room table met Mrs. Craven's requirements because she didn't make full-size quilts. She specialized in baby quilts, and her baby quilts were very special indeed. Each was handmade from start to finish, and no two were exactly alike.<br><br> She would have nothing to do with prepackaged polyester quilt kits or with the insipid appliqu�d kittens, puppies, and teddy bears the kits' manufacturers deemed suitable for a nursery. Mrs. Craven used only the softest of cotton fabrics to make brightly colored patchwork quilts in a seemingly limitless array of traditional patterns.<br><br> I knew next to nothing about quilt making, but the names of the patterns delighted me. Pastel kittens, puppies, and teddy bears seemed anemic compared with Old Maid's Ramble, Johnny 'Round the Corner, Victorian Fans, Tumbling Blocks, Pinwheels, and Broken Dishes.<br><br> Mrs. Craven "signed" her quilts by embroidering each one with a tiny black-and-white cow. She'd once told me that the little cows were a tribute to her father, who'd managed a prize-winning herd of Friesians for a local landowner when she was growing up. My sons made a game of finding the cows in her finished quilts when we visited Bluebell Cottage, and quite a few adults played the same game when she displayed her quilts at the church fete.<br><br> Of the many quilts Mrs. Craven created, my favorites were also the rarest. They were what she called her "whole-cloth" quilts. Whole-cloth quilt tops were neither pieced together from scraps nor brightly colored. They were made from a single piece of cream-colored fabric embellished from edge to edge with intricate patterns of meticulous cream-colored embroidery. Celtic knots, entwined hearts, feathers, fans, flowers, leaves, spirals, and shooting stars were but a few of the patterns that found their way into Mrs. Craven's whole-cloth quilts, and while the color palette was undeniably subtle, the needlework was nothing short of extraordinary.<br><br> Grant Tavistock and Charles Bellingham, who ran an art appraisal and restoration business from their home in Finch, classified Mrs. Craven as a genius. They could have introduced her to a dozen museum directors who would have jumped at the chance to exhibit her handiwork, but she was too humble even to consider showing her quilts to a knowledgeable curator.<br><br> Instead, she sold her small masterpieces from a stall at the annual church fete and donated every pound of the proceeds to St. George's. Thanks to her fund-raising efforts, the churchyard had a drainage system that could handle heavy downpours, the south porch had a watertight roof, and the lytch-gate had a new set of wrought-iron hinges.<br><br> Mothers who were lucky enough to own one or more of Mrs. Craven's quilts tended to keep them well away from their infants, for fear of the stains associated with infants. I'd framed the three whole-cloth quilts I'd purchased from her and hung them on a wall in our master bedroom. To me, they were works of art.<br><br> Mrs. Craven couldn't understand what all the fuss was about. She believed that her quilts served a practical purpose and she was a bit disappointed in me for treating them so reverently. She would have been better pleased if I'd allowed my children to chew on them, spit up on them, dribble on them, and anoint them with applesauce, pureed carrots, and other less savory substances. To Mrs. Craven, a well-used quilt was a well-loved quilt.<br><br> On a damp Thursday evening in early April, Bess and I spotted our elderly neighbor as she took a seat in one of the folding chairs Mr. Barlow had set up in the old schoolhouse, which had for many years served as Finch's village hall. The flower show, the art show, and the Nativity play were held there, but the orderly rows of folding chairs signaled the advent of a village affairs committee meeting. By the time Mrs. Craven arrived, nearly everyone who lived in Finch was present.<br><br> Millicent Scroggins, Opal Taylor, Selena Buxton, and Elspeth Binney&#x2014;whom Bill had dubbed "the Handmaidens" because of their devotion to his father&#x2014;sat together in the second row of chairs. I could hear them discussing Sally Cook's new pageboy haircut and whether or not it would suit Christine Peacock. Christine and Sally sat side by side between their respective husbands, making it easy for the Handmaidens to compare neck lengths, brow widths, and cheekbone breadths.<br><br> In the back row, Grant Tavistock and Charles Bellingham were deep in conversation with Horace Malvern, a local dairy farmer who wished to commission a portrait painting of his two-year-old grandson, little Horace Malvern III. James and Felicity Hobson had also chosen chairs in the back row, but though they sat together, they were engaged in separate conversations. While Felicity described the layout of her herb garden to Mr. Barlow, James described his newest piece of metal-detecting equipment to Lilian Bunting, who shared his interest in local history.<br><br> Lilian was married to the vicar of St. George's Church, but her husband hardly ever attended committee meetings. Theodore Bunting had inadvertently inspired the sin of envy in his flock by receiving a special dispensation from our all-powerful chairwoman, Peggy Taxman, to spend committee evenings at home in the vicarage, where he could enjoy a nice cup of cocoa while he worked out the kinks in the sermon he would deliver on Sunday.<br><br> Jasper Taxman and George Wetherhead sat at the long table on the dais that also served as the stage for the Nativity play. Jasper was the committee's treasurer and George was its secretary, but both men were overshadowed by Jasper's formidable wife, Peggy Taxman, who sat regally between them in the chairwoman's chair.<br><br> Bree Pym, a young New Zealander who'd inherited a house near Finch from her great-grandaunts, the late and much lamented Ruth and Louise Pym, arrived only minutes before Peggy called the meeting to order. Bree was temporarily on her own because her boyfriend, the noted conservationist Jack MacBride, was on a lecture tour in Scandinavia.<br><br> Bree Pym stood out in Finch because of her youth, her spiky hair, her tattooed arms, her pierced nostril, her highly original sense of style, and her refusal to be intimidated by Peggy Taxman. Peggy's gimlet gaze and stentorian harrumphs had absolutely no effect on Bree's behavior. If Bess wanted Bree to chase her around the schoolhouse in a game of Big Bad Bear during committee meetings, Bree would chase her, growling menacingly, regardless of the poisonous looks thrown at her from the dais. Bree was the young aunt I would have chosen for Bess, if I'd had a say in the matter.<br><br> Like Bree, Bess and I were temporarily on our own. Easter break was upon us and Bill had decided to put it to good use by taking Will and Rob on a ten-day, boys-only camping trip in the Lake District. To beat the weekend traffic, they'd loaded Bill's car on Wednesday evening and driven off in the wee hours of Thursday morning. I'd waved good-bye to them without the slightest twinge of resentment.<br><br> I was perfectly happy to be excluded from their adventure. The Lake District was the rainiest region in England, and while April wasn't one of its rainiest months, I could almost guarantee that April showers would do what they had to do to bring May flowers. The thought of being cooped up in a wet tent with a toddler who was still in diapers didn't fill me with glee.<br><br> Even a fair-weather camping trip wouldn't have appealed to me. I could too easily envision Bess toddling merrily into campfires, toasting forks, wasps' nests, and patches of poison ivy to regard camping as anything other than a hospital visit waiting to happen. If Bill and the boys had been spending ten days in a country hotel on the shores of Lake Windermere, I would have been green with envy. Since they weren't, I wasn't.<br><br>Mrs. Craven never missed a village affairs committee meeting,and I tried very hard to miss as few as possible. Peggy Taxman, who ran the post office, the general store, the greengrocer&#x2019;s shop, and every committee meeting that had ever been held in Finch, had a nasty habit of &#x201c;volunteering&#x201d; absentees for duties that invariably required the use of a broom and a small fleet of rubbish bins. Needlessto say, her meetings were always well attended.<br><br>Though Mrs. Craven had a spotless attendance record, she contributed nothing to the proceedings. In stark contrast to the rest of the villagers, who could discuss the pros and cons of purchasing a new tea urn for months on end, Mrs. Craven was content to sit in silence while vital decisions were made&#x2014;usually by Peggy Taxman&#x2014; about the harvest festival, the church fete, and the other events that filled the village calendar.<br><br>I suspected that Mrs. Craven&#x2019;s reticence stemmed from her humility. She was willing to share her opinions with me over a cup of tea in her snug little kitchen, but I couldn&#x2019;t convince her to express them to a wider audience.

Using the body&#x2019;s own natural antibodies, it can be used internally to relieve symptoms of tuberculosis, tumors, parasites, anemia, common colds, and allergies. It can also aid in external ailments including rashes, acne, boils, burns, and dry skin. This book provides an introduction to the principles of urine therapy, the history of its use, recent research and literature, various medical uses, and personal stories from people who have been cured by urine therapy. Included is a complete bibliography for those interested in expanding their knowledge of urine therapy through other sources.<br></p><p>Urine therapy...is an ancient Eastern tradition which is gaining popularity in the West. Devotees, who include the actress Sarah Miles, claim that it is the oldest of natural remedies and swear by its health enhancing properties. The venerable former prime minister of India, Morarji Desai - who was 99 and in excellent health when the author met him in 1994 - was open about the fact that he drank a glassful of his own urine every day. It was while he was in India in 1990 that Coen van der Kroon was given the opportunity to experience the therapy&#39;s benefits first hand, following an accident. Afterwards, he embarked on a long journey around the world to research its history, uses and efficacy. The Golden Fountain, the most complete book to date on urine therapy, is the result of those wide-ranging investigations. The author tackles his subject with sensitivity and conviction. He provides a comprehensive overview of urine therapy&#39;s history throughout the world, together with detailed case histories and a user-friendly guide to its practical application in relation to specific ailments. Swami Pragyamurti Saraswati, a strong advocate of urine therapy who teaches in London, has written an authoritative foreword to the book while individual accounts from people who have tried it and found it beneficial add a fascinating personal touch. As an intriguing do-it-yourself home treatment, urine therapy is often the subject of lively debate, but there&#39;s one thing that everybody agrees upon. It&#39;s absolutely free!<b>Coen Van Der Kroon</b> has extensively researched and documented the effects of urine therapy, and attended the first All India Conference on urine therapy.</p><h2>Last Call for the Living</h2><p>For bank teller Charlie Colquitt, it was just another Saturday.

Her style was one of supreme order. She loved having everything tidy, in its proper place, and in control. She loved to plan, and therefore she rarely ran out of anything, or forgot to do anything. She enjoyed a predictably efficient life. She was small, lithe, in good shape, and didn't look her age, which was forty-two years old. Her husband, Peter, was forty-six. He was a litigator with a respected San Francisco law firm, and didn't mind the commute to Ross, across the bridge. Ross was a prosperous, safe, highly desirable suburban community. They had moved there from the city sixteen years before because the school system was excellent. It was said to be the best in Marin.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Tanya and Peter had three children. Jason was eighteen and was leaving for college at the end of August. He was going to UC Santa Barbara, and although he couldn't wait to go, Tanya was going to miss him terribly. And they had twin daughters, Megan and Molly, who had just turned seventeen.<br><br>Tanya had loved every moment of the last eighteen years, being a full-time mom to her kids. It suited her perfectly. She never found it burdensome or boring. The tedium of driving car pools had never seemed intolerable to her. Unlike mothers who complained of it, she loved being with her children, dropping them off, picking them up, taking them to Cub Scouts and Brownies, and she had been head of the parents' association of their school for several years. She took pride in doing things for them, and loved going to Jason's Little League and basketball games, and whatever the girls did as well. Jason had been varsity in high school, and was hoping to make either the basketball or tennis team at UCSB.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>His two younger sisters, Megan and Molly, were fraternal twins, and were as different as night and day. Megan was small and blond like her mother. She had been an Olympic-caliber gymnast in her early teens, and only gave up national competitions when she found it was interfering with her work at school. Molly was tall, thin, and looked like Peter, with dark brown hair and endless legs. She was the only member of the family who had never played competitive sports. She was musical, artistic, loved taking photographs, and was a whimsical, independent soul. At seventeen, the twins were going into their senior year. Megan wanted to go to UC Berkeley like her mother, or maybe UCSB. Molly was thinking about going east, or to a college in California where she could follow artistic pursuits. She had been thinking seriously about USC in L.A., if she stayed out west. Although the twins were very close, they were both adamant about not going to the same school. They had been in the same school and class all through elementary and high school, and now they were both ready to go their own ways. Their parents thought it was a healthy attitude, and Peter was encouraging Molly to consider the Ivy League schools. Her grades were good enough, and he thought she'd do well in a high-powered academic atmosphere. She was considering Brown, where she could design her own curriculum in photography, or maybe film school at USC. All three of the Harris children had done exceptionally well in school.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Tanya was proud of her children, loved her husband, enjoyed her life, and had thrived in their twenty-year marriage. The years had flown by like minutes since she'd married Peter as soon as she'd graduated from college. He had just graduated from Stanford Law School, and joined the law firm where he still worked. And just about everything in their life had gone according to plan. There had been no major shocks or surprises, no disappointments in their marriage, no traumas with their kids as Jason, Megan, and Molly navigated through their teens. Tanya and Peter enjoyed spending a lot of time with all three of their children. They had no regrets, and were well aware of how fortunate they were. Tanya worked in a family homeless shelter in the city one day a week, and she took the girls with her whenever she could and their schedules allowed. They both had extracurricular pursuits, and did community service through school. Peter liked to tease Tanya about how boring they all were, and how predictable in their routines. Tanya took great pride in keeping it that way, for all of them. Everything about their life felt comfortable and safe.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Her childhood had not been quite as neat and clean, which was why she liked keeping their life so tidy. Some might have called her life with Peter overly sterile and controlled, but Tanya loved it that way, and so did he. Peter's own youth and adolescence had been very similar to the life he and Tanya had created for their children, a seemingly perfect world. In contrast, Tanya's childhood had been difficult and lonely, and frightening at times. Her father had been an alcoholic, and her parents had gotten divorced when she was three. She had only seen her father a few times after the divorce, and he died when she was fourteen. Her mother had worked hard as a paralegal to keep her in the best schools. She had died shortly after the twins were born, and Tanya had no siblings. An only child of only children, her family consisted of Peter, Jason, and the twins. They were the hub of her world. She cherished every moment that she spent with them. Even after twenty years of marriage, she couldn't wait for Peter to come home at night. She loved telling him what she'd done that day, sharing stories about the children, and hearing about his day. She still found his cases and courtroom experiences fascinating after twenty years, and she liked sharing her own work with him as well. He was always enthusiastic and encouraging about what she did.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Tanya had been a freelance writer ever since she'd graduated from college, and through all the years of their marriage. She loved doing it because it fulfilled her, added to their income, and she worked at home, without interfering with their children. She led something of a double life as a result. Devoted mother, wife, and caregiver by day, and singularly determined freelance writer at night. Tanya always said that to her, writing was as essential as the air she breathed. Freelance writing had proven to be the perfect occupation for her, and the articles and stories she'd written had been well reviewed and warmly received over the years. Peter always said he was immensely proud of her, and appeared to be supportive of her work, although from time to time, he complained about her long work nights, and the late hours when she came to bed. But he appreciated the fact that it never interfered with her mothering or devotion to him. She was one of those rare, talented women who still put her family first, and always had.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Tanya's first book had been a series of essays, mostly about women's issues. It had been published by a small publisher in Marin in the late 1980s, and reviewed mostly by obscure feminist reviewers, who approved of her theories, topics, and ideas. Her book hadn't been rabidly feminist, but was aware and independent, and the sort of thing one would expect a young woman to write. Her second book, published on her fortieth birthday, two years earlier, and eighteen years after her first book, had been an anthology of short stories, published by a major publisher, and had had an exceptionally good review in The New York Times Book Review. She had been thrilled.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>In between, she had been frequently published in literary magazines, and often in The New Yorker. She had published essays, articles, and short stories in a variety of magazines over the years. Her volume of work was consistent and prolific. When necessary, she slept little, and some nights not at all. Judging by the sales of her recent book of short stories, she had a loyal following both among average readers who enjoyed her work and among the literary elite. Several well-known and highly respected writers had written her letters of warm praise, and had commented favorably about her book in the press. As she was in all else, Tanya was meticulously conscientious about her work. She had managed to have a family, and still keep abreast of her work. For twenty years, she had set time aside every day to write. She was diligent and highly disciplined and the only time she took days off from her writing mornings was during school vacations, or when the children were home sick from school. In that case, they came first. Otherwise, nothing kept her from her work. In her hours away from Peter and the children, she was fanatical about her work. She let the phone go to voice mail, turned off her cell phone, and sat down to write every morning after her second cup of tea, once the kids had gone off to school.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>She also enjoyed writing in a more commercial vein, which was the profitable side of it for them, something Peter respected as well. She did occasional articles for the local Marin papers, now and then for the Chronicle, on an editorial basis. She liked writing funny pieces, and had a knack with comedic work, in a wry, witty tone, and now and then she wrote pure slapstick when describing the life of a housewife and mother, and scenes with her kids. Peter thought it was what she did best, and she enjoyed doing it. She liked writing funny stuff.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>The real money she'd made, compared to what she made on her articles and essays, was writing occasional scripts for soap operas on national TV. She had done quite a number of them over the years. They weren't high literary endeavors, and she had no pretensions about what she did. But they paid extremely well, and the shows she wrote for liked her work, and called her often. It wasn't work she was proud of, but she liked the money she made, and so...</p><h2>Kahlo</h2><p><strong>Suffering and the female experience</strong> &nbsp; The Mexican artist <strong>Frida Kahlo</strong> (1907-1954) is one of the most important 20th century painters, and one of the few Latin American artists to have achieved a global reputation. In 1983 her work was declared the property of the Mexican state.<br> <br> Kahlo was one of the daughters of an immigrant German photographer and a Mexican woman of Indian origin. Her life and work were more inextricably interwoven than in almost any other artist&#x2019;s case. Two events in her life were of crucial importance. When she was eighteen, a bus accident put her in hospital for a year with a smashed spinal column and fractured pelvis. It was in her sick bed that she first started to paint. Then, aged twenty-one, she married the world-famous Mexican mural artist Diego Rivera. She was to suffer the effects of the accident her whole life long, and was particularly pained by her inability to have children.<br> <br> Kahlo&#x2019;s arresting pictures, most of them small format self-portraits, express the burdens that weighed upon her soul: her unbearable physical pain, the grief that Rivera&#x2019;s occasional affairs prompted, the sorrow her childlessness caused her, her homesickness when living abroad and her longing to feel that she had put down roots, profound loneliness.

They reveal why some of grammar&#x2019;s best-known &#x201c;rules&#x201d; aren&#x2019;t&#x2013;and never were&#x2013;rules at all. They explain how Brits and Yanks wound up speaking the same language so differently, and why British English isn&#x2019;t necessarily purer. This playfully witty yet rigorously researched book sets the record straight about bogus word origins, politically correct fictions, phony fran�ais, fake acronyms, and more. English is an endlessly entertaining, ever-changing language, and yesterday&#x2019;s blooper could be tomorrow&#x2019;s bon mot&#x2013;or vice versa!

But he didn&#x2019;t describe England and America as &#x201c;two nations divided by a common language,&#x201d; though thousands of websites say so. What he did, though, was pass along a great story about how the two nations were indeed divided by their two Englishes at a meeting of Allied leaders during World War II.<br><br>&#x201c;The enjoyment of a common language was of course a supreme advantage in all British and American discussions,&#x201d; Churchill wrote in The Second World War. No interpreters were needed, for one thing, but there were &#x201c;differences of expression, which in the early days led to an amusing incident.&#x201d; The British wanted to raise an urgent matter, he said, and told the Americans they wished to &#x201c;table it&#x201d; (that is, bring it to the table). But to the Americans, tabling something meant putting it aside. &#x201c;A long and even acrimonious argument ensued,&#x201d; Churchill wrote, &#x201c;before both parties realised that they were agreed on the merits and wanted the same thing.&#x201d;<br><br>I&#x2019;m no mind reader, but I&#x2019;ll bet the Brits at the table felt their English was the real thing, while the Yanks felt apologetic about theirs. If there&#x2019;s one thing our two peoples agree on, it&#x2019;s that British English is purer than its American offshoot. My in-box gets pinged every week or two by a Brit with his knickers in a twist or an American with an inferiority complex. A typical comment: &#x201c;Why do you refer to &#x2018;American English&#x2019; and &#x2018;British English&#x2019; Surely it should be &#x2018;American English&#x2019; and &#x2018;proper English.&#x2019;&#x201d; Ouch! Is their English really more proper&#x2014;that is, purer&#x2014;than ours? Which one is more like the English spoken in the 1600s when the Colonies and the mother country began diverging linguistically?<br><br>First of all, &#x201c;American English&#x201d; and &#x201c;British English&#x201d; are how authorities refer to the two major branches of English, and reflect the changes in the language since the Colonies separated themselves linguistically from England. The differences are many, but they&#x2019;re minor from a grammarian&#x2019;s point of view. Most have to do with spelling, pronunciation, and usage. En?glish grammar is English grammar no matter where you live, despite a few exceptions here and there.<br><br>The truth is that neither English is more proper. In some respects American English is purer than British English: We&#x2019;ve preserved some usages and spellings and pronunciations that have changed over time in Britain. But the reverse is also true. The British have preserved much that has changed on our side of the Atlantic. In many cases, it&#x2019;s nearly impossible to tell which branch has history on its side. Take &#x201c;table,&#x201d; the word that gave those Allied leaders such grief. In the eighteenth century, the phrase &#x201c;to lay on the table&#x201d; could mean either to bring up or to defer. By the nineteenth century, the Brits had preserved one of those meanings and the Yanks the other. So the verb &#x201c;table&#x201d; meant one thing there and quite another here.<br><br>In case you&#x2019;re wondering who should get the credit for that crack about &#x201c;two nations divided by a common language,&#x201d; the answer is nobody exactly. George Bernard Shaw was quoted in 1942 as saying, &#x201c;England and America are two countries separated by the same language.&#x201d; But nobody is certain where or when he said it. What we do know is that Oscar Wilde said the same thing in different words in 1887: &#x201c;We have really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of course, language.&#x201d;<br><br>Sound Bites<br><br>We&#x2019;ve all seen My Fair Lady, on stage or screen or iPod or whatever, and we all have our favorite scenes. One of mine is the bit where Henry Higgins, the arrogant professor of phonetics, first encounters the flower girl Eliza Doolittle at Covent Garden and is appalled by her Cockney accent. Higgins belittles her for turning the language of Shakespeare and Milton into &#x201c;such disgusting and depressing noise,&#x201d; and she screeches, &#x201c;Ah-ah-aw-aw-<br><br>oo-oo.&#x201d; Fed up with her &#x201c;detestable boo-hooing,&#x201d; he sings, &#x201c;Why can&#x2019;t the English learn to speak?&#x201d;<br><br>So what would a real Professor Higgins make of the way Americans speak? We don&#x2019;t have to look hard to find the answer, and many apologetic Americans may be surprised to hear it. Professor William A. Read, a distinguished linguist, put it this way in a journal of philology: &#x201c;The pronunciation of educated Americans is in many respects more archaic than that of educated Englishmen.&#x201d; This should be no surprise, he said, since &#x201c;the phonetic basis of American pronunciation rests chiefly on the speech of Englishmen of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.&#x201d; And those Englishmen sounded much like the Americans of today. The &#x201c;English accent&#x201d; that we now associate with educated British speech is a relatively new phenomenon and ?didn&#x2019;t develop until after the American Revolution.<br><br>Look at the way the letter r is pronounced (or not pronounced), perhaps the most important difference in the speech of educated people in the US and the UK. Since Anglo-Saxon days, the English had pronounced the r in words like &#x201c;far,&#x201d; &#x201c;mother,&#x201d; &#x201c;world,&#x201d; &#x201c;church,&#x201d; and &#x201c;mourn.&#x201d; English speakers on both sides of the Atlantic pronounced the r&#x2019;s in these words when the Colonies broke away from England. Most Americans still do. But educated people in Britain began dropping their r&#x2019;s in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. The Americans most likely to drop their r&#x2019;s were those, like New Englanders, who had strong commercial and social ties with the mother country.<br><br>This dropping of r&#x2019;s in Britain ?didn&#x2019;t happen all of a sudden, and the sticklers of the day ?didn&#x2019;t take it lying down. &#x201c;The perception that the language was &#x2018;losing a letter&#x2019; was a cause of profound upset to some writers,&#x201d; the linguist David Crystal has written. The poet Keats, for example, was cruelly upbraided by critics for rhyming &#x201c;thoughts&#x201d; with &#x201c;sorts,&#x201d; and &#x201c;thorns&#x201d; with &#x201c;fawns.&#x201d; Lord Byron blamed a critical article for hastening Keats&#x2019;s death in 1821: &#x201c;&#x2019;Tis strange the mind, that very fiery particle, / Should let itself be snuffed out by an Article.&#x201d; But by the time Keats died, the dropped r was a standard feature of educated British pronunciation.<br><br>The other letter that&#x2019;s a dead giveaway in telling a Brit from a Yank is the a in a word like &#x201c;past.&#x201d; We all know how an American would say it&#x2014;with an a like the one in &#x201c;cat.&#x201d; And as anyone who&#x2019;s watched Masterpiece Theatre can tell you, the standard British pronunciation is PAHST. But it wasn&#x2019;t always so. The Brits used to say it the same way Americans do now. Here again, the Americans stuck with an old way of speaking, one the British abandoned about the same time they dropped their r&#x2019;s.<br><br>The a, like the r, has ping-ponged in British pronunciation. Until the 1500s, the English did indeed pronounce words like &#x201c;bath&#x201d; and &#x201c;laugh&#x201d; and &#x201c;dance&#x201d; with an &#x201c;ah.&#x201d; But in the sixteenth century they began pronouncing the a in what we now consider the American way (as in &#x201c;cat&#x201d;). So things remained for the next two or three hundred years. This is the a that went to America on the Mayflower in 1620. And this is the a that both the Redcoats and the Colonists used during the Revolutionary War. Not until the 1780s did Londoners begin pronouncing their a&#x2019;s like &#x201c;ahs&#x201d; again, and for a few decades the broad a and the short a battled it out. But by the early 1800s, educated Britain was saying BAHTH and LAHF and DAHNCE.<br><br>That&#x2019;s also about when literate Britons started pronouncing the h in &#x201c;herb.&#x201d; Before the nineteenth century, both the English and Americans pronounced it ERB. In fact, the word was usually spelled &#x201c;erbe&#x201d; for the first few hundred years after it was borrowed from the Old French erbe in the 1200s. The h was added later as a nod to the Latin original (herba, or grass), but the letter was silent. Today, Americans pronounce &#x201c;herb&#x201d; the way Shakespeare did, with a silent h, while the Bard wouldn&#x2019;t recognize the word in the mouths of the English.<br><br>Speaking of aitches, some British speakers, especially on the telly, use &#x201c;an&#x201d; before words like &#x201c;historic&#x201d; or &#x201c;hotel,&#x201d; and some Anglophiles over here are slavishly imitating them. For shame! Usage manuals on both sides of the Atlantic say the article to use is &#x201c;a,&#x201d; not &#x201c;an.&#x201d; The rule is that we use &#x201c;a&#x201d; before a word that begins with an h that&#x2019;s pronounced and &#x201c;an&#x201d; before a word that starts with a silent h. And dictionaries in both Britain and the United States say the h should be pronounced in &#x201c;historic&#x201d; and &#x201c;hotel&#x201d; as well as &#x201c;heroic,&#x201d; &#x201c;habitual,&#x201d; &#x201c;hypothesis,&#x201d; &#x201c;horrendous,&#x201d; and some other problem h-words.<br><br>When the British aren&#x2019;t adding or subtracting an h, stretching out an a, or dropping an r, they&#x2019;re chopping off whole syllables from words like &#x201c;secretary,&#x201d; &#x201c;necessary,&#x201d; &#x201c;military,&#x201d; &#x201c;extraordinary,&#x201d; &#x201c;satisfactory,&#x201d; &#x201c;literary,&#x201d; and others. &#x201c;Secretary,&#x201d; for example, is shortened to SEC-ruh-tre...</p><h2>Atlantic Coast Fishes of North America (Peterson Field Guide)</h2><p>The more than 1,000 species descriptions in this guide include information on range and habitat such as depths, bottom types, water temperatures, and salinity.

As the book opens, he is driving along a dark road when he is distracted by what seems to be a flight of arrows. He crashes into a ravine and suffers horrible burns over much of his body. As he recovers in a burn ward, undergoing the tortures of the damned, he awaits the day when he can leave the hospital and commit carefully planned suicide&#x2014;for he is now a monster in appearance as well as in soul. <br> <br> A beautiful and compelling, but clearly unhinged, sculptress of gargoyles by the name of Marianne Engel appears at the foot of his bed and insists that they were once lovers in medieval Germany. In her telling, he was a badly injured mercenary and she was a nun and scribe in the famed monastery of Engelthal who nursed him back to health. As she spins their tale in Scheherazade fashion and relates equally mesmerizing stories of deathless love in Japan, Iceland, Italy, and England, he finds himself drawn back to life&#x2014;and, finally, in love. He is released into Marianne's care and takes up residence in her huge stone house. But all is not well. For one thing, the pull of his past sins becomes ever more powerful as the morphine he is prescribed becomes ever more addictive. For another, Marianne receives word from God that she has only twenty-seven sculptures left to complete&#x2014;and her time on earth will be finished. <br> <br> Already an international literary sensation, <em>The Gargoyle</em> is an <em>Inferno</em> for our time. It will have you believing in the impossible. <br> <br> <strong>Andrew Davidson Talks About Becoming a Writer</strong> <br> <em>Some of what follows is true.</em> <br> <br> When I was about seven, I had a turtle named Stripe. I decided, because I liked my turtle and Jacques Cousteau, that I wanted to be a marine biologist. This ambition lasted until I was ten years old, when I spent a year gazing into the abyss, hoping that the abyss would not gaze back at me. At eleven, I longed for a master to teach me the secrets of the ninja, but the teacher did not appear; this probably means that as a student I was not ready. As I entered my teens, I set my heart upon becoming a professional hockey player. On weekend nights, the final game at the local arena ended around 10 p.m. but the icemaker was unable to leave the building until about midnight, as he had to clean the dressing rooms and do maintenance. I bribed him with presents of Aqua Velva aftershave to let me play alone on the rink until he headed home. Despite my devotion, I never developed the skills to make it off the small-town rink and into the big leagues. My dream shattered, at sixteen I started to spend more time writing. I began by changing the lyrics to Doors songs. I rewrote "Break On Through" so that it became "Live to Die": "Soldier in the forest / dodging bullets thick / only took one / to make him cry / All of us just live to die." Clearly, writing was my future. <br> <br> I soon realized that, since I still had no authorial voice of my own, I should at least imitate better poets than Jim Morrison. Soon I was word-raping Leonard Cohen, e.e. cummings, Sylvia Plath, William Blake, and John Milton. After writing much abusively derivative poetry, I moved onto stage plays written in a mockery of the style of Tennessee Williams, which also didn&#x2019;t work out so well. Next, I tried to put baby in a corner, until it was explained to me that nobody puts baby in a corner. Following this, I produced short stories that would have been much better if they were much shorter. Then, screenplays that even Alan Smithee wouldn&#x2019;t direct. <br> <br> Somewhere along the way, I managed to get a degree in English Literature; this was strange, as I thought I was studying cardiology. Undaunted, off to Vancouver Film School I went, but naturally not to study film. Instead, I took the new media course, because there was this thing called the internet that was just taking off. I also spent a fair amount of time using digital editing software for video and audio. An example project: I slowed down the final movement to Beethoven&#x2019;s Ninth Symphony, looped it backwards, put in a heavy drumbeat, and end up with a funeral dirge. "Ode to Joy"? I think not. "Ode to Bleakness" is more like it; I was very deep, and showed it by destroying joy. <br> <br> After this course finished, I had tens of thousands of dollars of student debt, and could no longer avoid getting a job. I soon discovered, in no uncertain terms, that work is no fun. I stuck it out for as long as I could, which was way less than a lifetime. As my thirtieth birthday approached, I became incredibly aware that I had never lived abroad, so I moved to Japan. <br> <br> I had no idea if I would like Japan, but I vowed to stick it out for a year. I did, and then another year, and another, and another, and another. In the beginning, I worked as a kind of substitute teacher of English, covering stints in classrooms that needed a temporary instructor. I lived in fifteen different cities during my first two years, traveling from the northern island of Hokkaido all the way down to the southern island of Okinawa. It was a great introduction to the country, but eventually the constant relocation became too much. I got a job in a Tokyo office, writing English lessons for Japanese learners on the internet. I lived in the big city for three years, and loved it: hooray for sushi, hooray for sumo, and hooray for cartoon mascots. <br> <br> While in Japan, I entertained myself by writing and, having already mangled poetry, short stories, stage plays and screenplays, I thought it was time to give a novel a shot. A strange thing happened: I found that I don&#x2019;t write like other people when it comes to novels&#x2014;or at least, none of which I know. It&#x2019;s true that I&#x2019;ve read comparisons of my novel to a number of other books&#x2014;<em>The Name of the Rose</em>, <em>The English Patient</em>, <em>The Shadow of the Wind</em>&#x2014;but I haven&#x2019;t read any of them. (To my great shame, really, and I suppose I should. Since they are my supposed influences, I should become familiar with them. I&#x2019;ll appear more intelligent in interviews.) <br> <br> I liked writing <em>The Gargoyle</em>, and I think I&#x2019;ll write another novel. If I can, I&#x2019;ll make up new characters and a new plot. That&#x2019;s my plan. <br> <br>Andrew Davidson grew up in Pinawa, Manitoba, and graduated in 1995 from the University of British Columbia with a B.A. in English literature. He has worked as a teacher of English in Japan, where he has lived on and off since the late 1990s, and as a writer of English lessons for Japanese websites. <b>The Gargoyle</b>, the product of seven years&#x2019; worth of research and composition, is his first novel.</p><h2>Salad of the Day (Williams-Sonoma): 365 Recipes for Every Day of the Year</h2><p>This enticing collection of 365 recipes offers a salad for each day of the year.

While there are a few grim moments, the emphasis is on the absurdities of Soviet life and the manipulability of the system for those who, like the Dovlatovs, have the right connections. Though the names of many Soviet celebrities mentioned here will be known only to specialists, and there are a few lapses into hyperbole, this well-written and carefully translated book by a Russian emigre novelist is likely to come as a revelation to readers whose knowledge of modern Russian history derives from Solzhenitsyn and other memoirists who experienced the brutality of Stalin.<br><i>- Robert Decker, Harriman Inst., Columbia</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Baby Danced the Polka (ALA Notable Children&#39;s Books.

In this memoir, Halifu Osumare reflects on what blackness and dance have meant to her life and international career.<br><br>Osumare's story begins in 1960s San Francisco amid the Black Arts Movement, black militancy, and hippie counterculture. It was there that she chose dance as her own revolutionary statement. She moved to Europe, where she taught "jazz ballet" and established her own dance company in Copenhagen. Returning to the United States, she danced with the Rod Rodgers Dance Company in New York City and played key roles in integrating black dance programs into mainstream programmingat the Lincoln Center. After dance fieldwork in Ghana, Osumare returned to California and helped develop Oakland's black dance scene. Along the way, she collaborated with major artistic movers and shakers: among them, Katherine Dunham, Pearl Primus, Jean-Leon Destine, and Donald McKayle.<br><br>Now a black studies scholar, Osumare uses her extraordinary experiences to reveal the overlooked ways that dance has been a vital tool in the black struggle for recognition, justice, and self-empowerment. This is the inspiring story of an accomplished dance artist and a world-renowned dance scholar who has boldly developed and proclaimed her identity as a black woman.</p><p><b>Halifu Osumare</b>, professor emerita of African American and African Studies at the University of California, Davis, is the author of <i>The Hiplife in Ghana: West African Indigenization of Hip-Hop</i> and <i>The Africanist Aesthetic in Global Hip-Hop: Power Moves.</i>&#x201c;Osumare has engaged with black dance as performer, choreographer, educator, arts administrator, researcher, and activist in the United States, Africa, and Europe, and through multiple careers. In this equal parts memoir, autoethnography, history, encyclopedic catalog, and sociocultural analysis, she traces her activities from the 1960s through the late 1990s, as she becomes a tenacious advocate for black dance. . . .

He begins with his childhood among the eccentric extended Pamuk family in the dusty, carpeted, and hermetically sealed apartment building they shared. In this place came his first intimations of the melancholy awareness that binds all residents of his city together: that of living in the seat of ruined imperial glories, in a country trying to become &#x201c;modern&#x201d; at the dizzying crossroads of East and West. This elegiac communal spirit overhangs Pamuk&#x2019;s reflections as he introduces the writers and painters (among the latter, most particularly the German Antoine-Ignace Melling) through whose eyes he came to see Istanbul. Against a background of shattered monuments, neglected villas, ghostly backstreets, and, above all, the fabled waters of the Bosphorus, he presents the interplay of his budding sense of place with that of his predecessors. And he charts the evolution of a rich, sometimes macabre, imaginative life, which furnished a daydreaming boy refuge from family discord and inner turmoil, and which would continue to serve the famous writer he was to become. It was, and remains, a life fed by the changing microcosm of the apartment building and, even more, the beckoning kaleidoscope beyond its walls. <br><br>As much a portrait of the artist as a young man as it is an oneiric Joycean map of the city, <i>Istanbul</i> is a masterful evocation of its subject through the idiosyncrasies of direct experience as much as the power of myth--the dazzling book Pamuk was born to write.</p><p>Orhan Pamuk&#x2019;s work has been translated into more than thirty languages. He lives in Istanbul.<i>Chapter One<br><br>Another Orhan</i><br><br>From a very young age, I suspected there was more to my world than I could see: Somewhere in the streets of Istanbul, in a house resembling ours, there lived another Orhan so much like me that he could pass for my twin, even my double. I can&#x2019;t remember where I got this idea or how it came to me. It must have emerged from a web of rumors, misunderstandings, illusions, and fears. But in one of my earliest memories, it is already clear how I&#x2019;ve come to feel about my ghostly other.<br><br>When I was five I was sent to live for a short time in another house. After one of their many stormy separations, my parents arranged to meet in Paris, and it was decided that my older brother and I should remain in Istanbul, though in separate places. My brother would stay in the heart of the family with our grandmother in the Pamuk Apartments, in Niflantafl�, but I would be sent to stay with my aunt in Cihangir. Hanging on the wall in this house&#x2013;where I was treated with the utmost kindness&#x2013;was a picture of a small child, and every once in a while my aunt or uncle would point up at him and say with a smile, &#x201c;Look! That&#x2019;s you!&#x201d;<br><br>The sweet doe-eyed boy inside the small white frame did look a bit like me, it&#x2019;s true. He was even wearing the cap I sometimes wore. I knew I was not that boy in the picture (a kitsch representation of a &#x201c;cute child&#x201d; that someone had brought back from Europe). And yet I kept asking myself, Is this the Orhan who lives in that other house?<br><br>Of course, now I too was living in another house. It was as if I&#x2019;d had to move here before I could meet my twin, but as I wanted only to return to my real home, I took no pleasure in making his acquaintance. My aunt and uncle&#x2019;s jovial little game of saying I was the boy in the picture became an unintended taunt, and each time I&#x2019;d feel my mind unraveling: my ideas about myself and the boy who looked like me, my picture and the picture I resembled, my home and the other house&#x2013;all would slide about in a confusion that made me long all the more to be at home again, surrounded by my family.<br><br>Soon my wish came true. But the ghost of the other Orhan in another house somewhere in Istanbul never left me. Throughout my childhood and well into adolescence, he haunted my thoughts. On winter evenings, walking through the streets of the city, I would gaze into other people&#x2019;s houses through the pale orange light of home and dream of happy, peaceful families living comfortable lives. Then I would shudder to think that the other Orhan might be living in one of these houses. As I grew older, the ghost became a fantasy and the fantasy a recurrent nightmare. In some dreams I would greet this Orhan&#x2013;always in another house&#x2013;with shrieks of horror; in others the two of us would stare each other down in eerie merciless silence. Afterward, wafting in and out of sleep, I would cling ever more fiercely to my pillow, my house, my street, my place in the world. Whenever I was unhappy, I imagined going to the other house, the other life, the place where the other Orhan lived, and in spite of everything I&#x2019;d half convince myself that I was he and took pleasure in imagining how happy he was, such pleasure that, for a time, I felt no need to go to seek out the other house in that other imagined part of the city.<br><br>Here we come to the heart of the matter: I&#x2019;ve never left Istanbul, never left the houses, streets, and neighborhoods of my childhood. Although I&#x2019;ve lived in different districts from time to time, fifty years on I find myself back in the Pamuk Apartments, where my first photographs were taken and where my mother first held me in her arms to show me the world. I know this persistence owes something to my imaginary friend, the other Orhan, and to the solace I took from the bond between us. But we live in an age defined by mass migration and creative immigrants, so I am sometimes hard-pressed to explain why I&#x2019;ve stayed, not only in the same place but in the same building. My mother&#x2019;s sorrowful voice comes back to me: &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you go outside for a while? Why don&#x2019;t you try a change of scene, do some traveling . . . ?&#x201d;<br><br>Conrad, Nabokov, Naipaul&#x2013;these are writers known for having managed to migrate between languages, cultures, countries, continents, even civilizations. Their imaginations were fed by exile, a nourishment drawn not through roots but through rootlessness. My imagination, however, requires that I stay in the same city, on the same street, in the same house, gazing at the same view. Istanbul&#x2019;s fate is my fate. I am attached to this city because it has made me who I am.<br><br>Gustave Flaubert, who visited Istanbul 102 years before my birth, was struck by the variety of life in its teeming streets; in one of his letters he predicted that in a century&#x2019;s time it would be the capital of the world. The reverse came true: After the Ottoman Empire collapsed, the world almost forgot that Istanbul existed. The city into which I was born was poorer, shabbier, and more isolated than it had ever been before in its two-thousand-year history. For me it has always been a city of ruins and of end-of-empire melancholy. I&#x2019;ve spent my life either battling with this melancholy or (like all &#x2039;stanbullus) making it my own.<br><br>At least once in a lifetime, self-reflection leads us to examine the circumstances of our birth. Why were we born in this particular corner of the world, on this particular date? These families into which we were born, these countries and cities to which the lottery of life has assigned us&#x2013;they expect love from us, and in the end we do love them from the bottom of our hearts; but did we perhaps deserve better? I sometimes think myself unlucky to have been born in an aging and impoverished city buried under the ashes of a ruined empire. But a voice inside me always insists this was really a piece of luck. If it is a matter of wealth, I can certainly count myself fortunate to have been born into an affluent family at a time when the city was at its lowest ebb (though some have ably argued the contrary). Mostly, I am disinclined to complain; I&#x2019;ve accepted the city into which I was born in the same way that I&#x2019;ve accepted my body (much as I would have preferred to be more handsome and better built) and my gender (even though I still ask myself, na�vely, whether I might been better off had I been born a woman). This is my fate, and there&#x2019;s no sense arguing with it. This book is concerned with fate.<br><br>I was born in the middle of the night on June 7, 1952, in a small private hospital in Moda. Its corridors, I&#x2019;m told, were peaceful that night, and so was the world. Aside from the Strambolini volcano&#x2019;s having suddenly begun to spew flames and ash two days earlier, relatively little seems to have been happening on our planet. The newspapers were full of small news: a few stories about the Turkish troops fighting in Korea; a few rumors spread by Americans stoking fears that the North Koreans might be preparing to use biological weapons. In the hours before I was born, my mother had been avidly following a local story: Two days earlier, the caretakers and &#x201c;heroic&#x201d; residents of the Konya Student Center had seen a man in a terrifying mask trying to enter a house in Langa through the bathroom window; they&#x2019;d chased him through the streets to a lumberyard, where, after cursing the police, the hardened criminal had committed suicide; a seller of dry goods identified the corpse as a gangster who the year before had entered his shop in broad daylight and robbed him at gunpoint.<br><br>When she was reading the latest on this drama, my mother was alone in her room, or so she told me with a mixture of regret and annoyance many years later. After taking her to the hospital, my father had grown restless and, when my mother&#x2019;s labor failed to progress, he&#x2019;d gone out to meet with friends. The only person with her in the delivery room was my aunt, who&#x2019;d managed to climb over the hospital&#x2019;s garden wall in the middle of the night. When my mother first set eyes on me, she found me thinner and more fragile than my brother had been.<br><br>I feel compelled to add or so I&#x2019;ve been told. In Turkish we have a special tense that allows us to distinguish hearsay from what we&#x2019;ve seen with our own eyes; when we are relating dreams, fairy tales, or past events we could not have witnessed, we use this tense. It is a useful distinction to make as we &#x201c;remember&#x201d; our earliest life experiences, our cradles, our baby carriages, our first steps, all as reported by our parents, stories to which we listen with the same rapt attention we might pay some brilliant tale of some other person. It&#x2019;s a sensation as sweet as seeing ourselves in our dreams, but we pay a heavy price for it. Once imprinted in our minds, other people&#x2019;s reports of what we&#x2019;ve done end up mattering more than what we ourselves remember. And just as we learn about our lives from others, so too do we let others shape our understanding of the city in which we live.<br><br>At times when I accept as my own the stories I&#x2019;ve heard about my city and myself, I&#x2019;m tempted to say, &#x201c;Once upon a time I used to paint. I hear I was born in Istanbul, and I understand that I was a somewhat curious child. Then, when I was twenty-two, I seem to have begun writing novels without knowing why.&#x201d; I&#x2019;d have liked to write my entire story this way&#x2013;as if my life were something that happened to someone else, as if it were a dream in which I felt my voice fading and my will succumbing to enchantment. Beautiful though it is, I find the language of epic unconvincing, for I cannot accept that the myths we tell about our first lives prepare us for the brighter, more authentic second lives that are meant to begin when we awake. Because&#x2013;for people like me, at least&#x2013;that second life is none other...</p><h2>Native Treasures: Gardening With the Plants of California (Phyllis M.

Sheila Paine traveled all over the world--from Afghanistan, Russia, and Albania, to Cameroon, Tunisia, and Mexico--to research the form, properties, and use of amulets, whether for health and safety or as channels for spiritual or magical powers. Worn as necklaces, sewn to clothing, painted on buildings, or hung in vehicles, amulets guard babies and brides; warriors, hunters, and travelers; livestock, crops, and homes through magical, not physical, means. Malign spirits and hobgoblins at crossroads have been feared since ancient times, but modern dangers--car crashes, new diseases, even cell phones--have ensured an abiding faith in the magical protection that amulets afford us that is still widely evident today.</p><p>CULTURAL STUDIES / ART<br><br>All over the world and throughout history amulets have offered protection against negative forces. The power of amulets is based on the underlying, widespread belief that all things in the natural world have a spirit and a power that links them together. Intricately beautiful or starkly simple, amulets come in an astonishing variety of guises: from stones, shells, and seeds, through animal tails, teeth, and claws, to beads, mirrors, needles, and bells. Used alone or combined in intricate patterns, they are all part of a system of natural and magical forces that can be used to redress evil influences.<br><br>When the Great Plague swept across Europe and hit London in 1665, the disease was believed to be caused by the wrath of God and spread by the bad odors emanating from the sick. On still days, church bells were rung and shots fired to drive off the disease by moving the air. Birds were kept in rooms to sing and create drafts. But strong-smelling amulets, pomanders of cloves and spices, were considered the best protection.<br><br>It is particularly in such a climate of deadly pestilence caused by forces unknown and not understood--as in the case of AIDS in Africa today--that the power of amulets thrives. Until well into the nineteenth century, illness was commonly believed to be the work of evil spirits, demons, witches, the evil eye, angry gods, or even ancestors. In the face of such supernatural forces a magical defense acquired its own rationality.<br><br>Babies are particularly vulnerable to evil forces and illness. High infant mortality rates--the causes of which are not understood--are confronted by a plethora of beads, stones, and bags of herbs hung around the child&#x2019;s neck. In the Golden Triangle, the region where Thailand, Myanmar (Burma), and Laos all meet, neck rings are put on a few days after birth and kept on night and day. These hold the soul in the body ensuring the humanity of the child and protecting it from evil. Tribes in southern China hold evil spirits at bay by dressing their children in hats that fool the spirits into thinking the child is a flower, an owl, or even a tiger or dragon.<br><br>Amulets are not just something from the distant past.

With a profound understanding of the quandary of modern women, Carolyn Graglia shows that the cultural assault on marriage, motherhood, and traditional sexuality, rooted in the pursuit of economic and political power, has robbed women of their surest source of fulfillment. <p>Mrs. Graglia traces the origins of modern feminism to the post-war exaltation of marketplace achievement, which bred dissatisfaction with women's domestic roles. In a masterly analysis of seminal feminist texts, she reveals a conscious campaign of ostracism of the housewife as a childish "parasite". Turning to the feminist understanding of sexuality, now pervasive in our culture, she shows how it has distorted and impoverished sex by stripping it of its true significance. Finally, after exposing feminism's totalitarian impulse and its contribution to the "tangle of pathologies" that have left marriage and family life in tatters, she argues for a renewed appreciation of the transforming experience of motherhood and the value of the domestic vocation.</p></p><p>F. CAROLYN GRAGLIA, a lawyer by training and a housewife by choice, is superbly qualified to analyze the varied roles of women in our society. She received her undergraduate degree from Cornell University (1951) and her law degree from Columbia University (1954), where she was an editor of the law review. After working in the Justice Department, she clerked on the D.C. Court of Appeals for Warren E. Burger, the future Chief Justice, and later worked for the Washington firm of Covington &amp; Burling. Mrs. Graglia left this successful career to care for her husband and three children. A frequent lecturer at universities, she lives in Austin with her husband of forty-three years, Professor Lino Graglia of the University of Texas Law School."If there is a book our culture has been needing for the last thirty years, Domestic Tranquility is it." -- <i>Phyllis Schlafly</i><br><br>...makes a strong case that feminism has not increased the sum of human happiness... Mrs. Graglia offers a thinking woman's argument for putting family first. -- <i>The Wall Street Journal, Lisa Schiffren</i><br><br>William Kristol (The Weekly Standard) calls the book "a stunningly bold and deep assault on the most powerful movement of our time-feminism. A genuinely thought-provoking book." Danielle Crittenden of The Women's Quarterly praises it as "a stunning indictment of the women's movement and its radical vision of female equality. Carolyn Graglia is a courageous thinker." <p>"Rarely does a book draw such a rave from one of our reviewers. And Dan Neyer is one of our hardest to please, so you can be sure he brought us to the edge of our seats. Why all the fuss? A few lines from Dan's exuberant 4-page analysis: </p><p>'F. Carolyn Graglia, a lawyer before she became a homemaker, makes an unassailable case against feminism.... [She] holds feminism up to the light and reveals it to be anti-female and anti-human....' </p><p>'Although Graglia never uses the term satanic to describe the feminists, she is unstinting in her condemnation of them. She makes it clear that female promiscuity, legalized abortion, increased male impotence, bureaucratic eunuchs, and increased homosexuality are all products of feminism. God bless her for writing this book. And as she asks in the book: Where are all the men? Why don't they oppose the feminists? Why is F. Carolyn Graglia the only person attacking them? It is partly because the feminists have so successfully gelded American males, and partly because males, through a misplaced notion of chivalry, do not believe in attacking women. But when women cease to be women they must be dealt with. Deep down the real reason the feminists hate men, Graglia tells us, is because men do not love them enough to challenge them when they misbehave. That is a very unpopular thing to say, but Graglia has the moral fortitude to say it, and say it very well.' </p><p>'Mrs. Graglia makes her points cannily. Her research includes sources who don't share her traditional views, so the book packs a double wallop. Perhaps more importantly, Mrs. Graglia doesn't leave us hanging. She shows us how to begin anew to respect and support both the woman who undertakes a traditional role and the man who makes it possible for her to do so. It all adds up to the most stinging indictment of feminism ever written.'" -- <i>Conservative Book Club, Featured Alternate Main Selection</i></p></p><h2>A New View of a Woman&#39;s Body</h2><p>Fully illustrated guide by the Federation of Feminist Women&#39;s Health Centers, covers a very wide range of topics vital to women&#39;s health.</p><p></p><h2>Mary&#39;s Message to the World</h2><p>Reports messages received by a non-Catholic nurse from Texas from the Virgin Mary, prophecying environmental disasters, recounting her earthly life, and teaching about love, prayer, and other topics</p><p>Over 500,000 copies of Mary's Message in print...As relevant today as when it was written...In 1995 Mother Mary said that the most dire predictions had been delayed up to 10 years ...now it is 2005, and we are all seeing the Eath Changes return.This book contains a series of "talks" as given by Mary, the Mother of Jesus, to a woman in Texas from 1987 to 1991, which are as relevant today as when they were first written.At Fatima, Lourdes, and more recently, Medjugorie, Mother Mary has spoken through miraculous apparitions.

The lion was given to his older brother, Don, while he was traveling as a professional wrestler, and he shipped it home. The family kept Sheba in the basement fruit cellar until Don returned and their mother convinced him to give it to the Buffalo zoo. </p><p>Ted always knew he wanted to be an illustrator. As a child he copied the work of illustrators and painters he admired, including N. C. Wyeth, Winslow Homer, John Singer Sargent, Vel�zquez, and Goya. When it came time to go to art school (Pratt), he needed to earn money to finance his education. So, following in his brother&#x2019;s footsteps, he took a summer job as a wrestler -- the beginning of a 15-year part-time career that eventually inspired his autobiographical book <em>I Was a Teenage Professional Wrestler.</em> Ted&#x2019;s career as an artist began with illustrations for adventure magazines, and it&#x2019;s only over the last several years that he has devoted his time to writing and illustrating children&#x2019;s books. "I&#x2019;m having more fun doing this than anything I&#x2019;ve ever done before," he says. He is an avid traveler, and many of his books are inspired by trips to such places as the Amazon River, the Sahara Desert, Botswana, Egypt, Lapland, and India.

Top Taliban leaders actually tried to surrender within months of the US invasion, renouncing all political activity and submitting to the new government. Effectively, the Taliban ceased to exist&#x2015;yet the Americans were unwilling to accept such a turnaround. Instead, driven by false intelligence from their allies and an unyielding mandate to fight terrorism, American forces continued to press the conflict, resurrecting the insurgency that persists to this day. <br>With its intimate accounts of life in war-torn Afghanistan, Gopal's thoroughly original reporting lays bare the workings of America's longest war and the truth behind its prolonged agony.

When teenager Noor Ahmed arrived that day in Gayawa to buy firewood, he knew it immediately: there was no call to prayer. Almost every village in Afghanistan has a mosque, and normally you can hear the muezzin&#x2019;s tinny song just before dawn, signaling the start of a new day. But for the first time that he could remember, there was not a sound. The entire place seemed lifeless.</p> <p>He walked down a narrow goat trail, toward low houses with enclosures of mud brick, and saw that the gates of many of them had been left open. The smell of burning rubber hung in the air. Near a creek, something brown lying in the yellow grass caught his eye, and he stopped to look at it. It was a disfigured body, caked in dried blood. Noor Ahmed took a few steps back and ran to the mosque, but it was empty. He knocked on the door of a neighboring home. It, too, was empty. He tried another one. Empty. Then he came upon an old mud schoolhouse, its front gate ajar, and stopped to listen. Stepping inside, he walked through a long yard strewn with disassembled auto parts and empty motor oil canisters. Finally, when he pushed his way through the front door, he saw them huddled in the corner: men and women, toddlers and teenagers, more than a dozen in total, clutching each other, crammed into a single room.</p> <p>&#x201c;Everyone else is dead,&#x201d; one said. &#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t get out of here, they&#x2019;ll kill you, too.&#x201d;</p> <p>In wartime Afghanistan, secrets are slippery things. The Taliban had planned a surprise attack on Gayawa, but the villagers had known for days that the raid was coming, and those who could had hired cars or donkeys and moved their families down into the valley. But this had been a hard, dry, unhappy summer. Times were not good and many villagers could not afford to leave, even though they knew what might await them. Of those who stayed, only the few hiding in the schoolhouse, where the Taliban soldiers never thought to look, escaped untouched. The rest met an unknown fate.</p> <p>Back then, Gayawa was near the epicenter of a brutal, grinding war between the government of Afghanistan, controlled by the Taliban, and a band of rebel warlords known as the Northern Alliance. In their drive to crush the resistance, government troops waged a Shermanesque campaign, burning down houses and schools, destroying lush grape fields that had for generations yielded raisins renowned throughout South Asia, and setting whole communities in flight. In the region surrounding Gayawa, the Taliban enforced a blockade, allowing neither food nor supplies to enter. Those who attempted to breach the cordon were shot.</p> <p>America&#x2019;s war had yet to begin, but on that September 11, Afghans had already been fighting for more than two decades. The troubles dated to 1979, when the Soviet Union invaded a largely peaceful country and ushered in a decadelong occupation that left it one of the most war-ravaged nations on Earth. The Russians withdrew in defeat in 1989, and in their wake scores of anti-Soviet resistance groups turned their guns on each other, unleashing a civil war that killed tens of thousands more and reduced to rubble what little infrastructure the country still had. Rival gangs robbed travelers at gunpoint and plucked women and boys off the streets with impunity.</p> <p>In 1994, a fanatical band of religious students&#x2014;the Taliban&#x2014;emerged to sweep aside these warring factions and put an end to the civil war. On a fierce platform of law and order, they forcibly disarmed and disbanded many of the militias that had been terrorizing the populace and brought nearly 90 percent of the country under their control. For the first time in more than a decade, peace took root in much of the land. Criminality and warlordism vanished, and the streets became safe from rape and abduction.</p> <p>In the process, however, the Taliban instituted a regime of draconian purity the likes of which the world had never witnessed. Moral and spiritual decay had dragged the country into civil war, the Taliban believed, and a puritanical version of Islamic law offered the only hope for salvation. All music, film, and photography&#x2014;which the Taliban regarded as gateway drugs to pornography and licentiousness&#x2014;were banned. They caged up women in their homes, executed adulterers, and whipped men of flagging faith. They prohibited, with only a few exceptions, all female education and employment. They outlawed the teaching of secular subjects in school. In many cities, roaming packs of religious police under the authority of the Ministry for the Prevention of Vice and Promotion of Virtue saw to it that no one missed the mandatory five-times-a-day prayer. All men were required to wear a fist-length beard and were beaten and jailed unless they complied.</p> <p>A land of Old Testament rules, the Taliban&#x2019;s Afghanistan was brutal and vindictive. Relatives of murder victims were invited to gun down the accused; thieves had their hands lopped off; and obscurantist religious clerics, often semiliterate, decided matters of jurisprudence. If it were possible to distill the zeitgeist into a single devastating moment, it would be the Taliban&#x2019;s infamous demolition of two massive fifteen-hundred-year-old Buddha sculptures. Among South Asia&#x2019;s great archaeological treasures, the statues were brought tumbling down in an effort to rid the country of &#x201c;false idols.&#x201d;</p> <p>Yet Taliban rule did not go unchallenged. Remnants of some of the defeated militias fled to the mountains north of Kabul, Afghanistan&#x2019;s capital, where they regrouped in 1996 to form the Northern Alliance. For the next five years, Taliban troops fought a bloody campaign to subdue the north, meting out the greatest punishment to villages along the front line, like Gayawa.</p> <p>Years later, I visited Gayawa to try to understand the Afghan world as it had appeared on the eve of 9/11. Some of the Taliban&#x2019;s old, rotting observation posts were still standing, and many houses remained abandoned. Memories of those war years lingered, and the rancor echoed in conversation after conversation. &#x201c;The Taliban were evil. They were tormentors,&#x201d; Noor Ahmed told me. After finding those survivors in the schoolhouse on the morning of September 11, he had fled the area, returning only months later after a new government had assumed power. &#x201c;They weren&#x2019;t humans. The laws you and I abide by, they didn&#x2019;t mean anything to them.&#x201d;</p> <p>As I met more villagers in the area, I found that many of their stories centered on a particular roving Taliban unit, a feared team of disciplinarians who journeyed from village to village demanding taxes and household firearms. &#x201c;Their leader was a tall man named Mullah Cable,&#x201d; said Nasir, a local. &#x201c;We heard his name on the radio. He traveled a lot. He would search your house looking for weapons, and when you swore you didn&#x2019;t have anything, he&#x2019;d bring out his whip, a cable. That&#x2019;s where his name comes from. He was a clever man&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t know where he was from, but he was very smart. He was one of the first to use a whip on us like that. After a while, all the Talibs started carrying whips.&#x201d;</p> <p>Mullah Cable. The very name spoke of the strange language that Afghans had acquired in decades of war. No one in Gayawa knew quite what had become of him. &#x201c;When the Americans invaded,&#x201d; Nasir said, &#x201c;all those Taliban vanished like ghosts.&#x201d;</p>&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013; <p></p> <p>I first saw Mullah Cable on an early winter evening in Kabul, the hour of dueling muezzins, dozens of them crooning from their minarets. It was 2009, and more than one hundred thousand foreign soldiers were on Afghan soil battling an increasingly powerful Taliban insurgency. When I approached him, he was pacing uncomfortably in a park, hands in his pockets, his eyes shifty, a black turban stuffed into his pocket. Tall and lanky, he stood with his shoulders hunched, as if he were carrying some dangerous secret. He wore glasses, unusual for an Afghan. Tattoos flowed down his arms and henna dye covered his fingernails. When he smiled, gold teeth glistened. Only his thick, spongy beard and a missing eye, a battlefield injury, placed him unmistakably among his Taliban comrades. Even without such telltale marks, though, as an Afghan you can never truly hide&#x2014;a cousin, or an old war buddy, or a tribal chieftain somewhere would know how to find you. So I had tracked him down, and after months of effort I finally convinced him to speak to me.</p> <p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t come here often,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Kabul is a strange place. I&#x2019;m a village guy. I need the open spaces and fields to be able to think.&#x201d; As the typical Kabul evening smog settled in, commuters headed home, many with their faces wrapped in handkerchiefs. Toyota Corolla station wagons and minivan taxis, with arms and heads poking out, rattled by. A Ford Ranger police truck passed us, making Mullah Cable nervous. He had slipped in from the surrounding countryside and was worried about being noticed. We took shelter in a taxi, moving slowly through the darkening streets as we spoke in the back.</p> <p>Almost a decade after battling the Northern Alliance, he was still fighting&#x2014;now against the Americans. Though he didn&#x2019;t mention it, I later learned that the band of guerrillas under his command in the province of Wardak, a few dozen miles southwest of Kabul, had assassinated members of the US-backed Afghan government, kidnapped policemen, and deployed suicide bombers. On numerous occasions, they had attacked American soldiers. He fought, he told me, for &#x201c;holy jihad,&#x201d; to rid his country of foreigners and to reinstate the Taliban regime.</p> <p>This much I had expected, but he also surprised me. He admitted to not having received a single day&#x2019;s worth of religious instruction in his life. He could read only with great difficulty. Maps were a mystery to him, and despite his best efforts he could not locate the United States. In fact, growing up he had only the foggiest notion of America&#x2019;s existence. He cared little for, and understood little of, international politics. He had no opinions about events in the Middle East or the Arab-Israeli conflict. And even though he had been a Taliban commander in the 1990s, after the American-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 he had quit the movement and for a time actually supported the new US-backed government.</p> <p>This is what fascinated me most: How did such a person end up declaring war on America? Nor was he alone. It turned out that thousands of Talibs like him had given up the fighter&#x2019;s life after 2001, but something had brought most of them back to the battlefield just a few years later. I wanted to learn his story. At first he was skeptical. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand why it matters,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;My story isn&#x2019;t very special. I think you won&#x2019;t find it interesting.&#x201d; I assured him that I would, and for a year we met regularly in the backs of taxis, in drowsy dark offices in Kabul, or out in the countryside. In his tale I found a history of America&#x2019;s war on terror itself, the first grand global experiment of the twenty-first century, and a glimpse of how he and thousands like him came to define themselves under this new paradigm&#x2014;how they came to be our enemy.</p>&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013; <p></p> <p>As with so many Afghans, the beginning was hazy. He could not state where exactly he had been born, although he believed it was somewhere on the squalid outskirts of Kabul. Nor did he know when he was born, so he wasn&#x2019;t sure if he was three or five when the Russians invaded in 1979. That war had unfolded mostly in the countryside, and people in Kabul spoke of it the way they spoke of foreign countries, as something far off and vaguely interesting. But the Russian retreat, followed by the outbreak of civil war in 1992, brought the conflict home to the capital, and eventually he enlisted in a local militia. It was an &#x201c;aimless life,&#x201d; as he put it, until the Taliban swept into power in 1996, inspiring thousands of young men to rally to their cause. He was one of them.</p> <p>The Taliban provided a welcome home for unsettled youths like him who were repulsed by the chaos. In their regimented order he found a sense of purpose, a communion with something greater. &#x201c;You have to understand,&#x201d; he explained, &#x201c;we felt like we were the most powerful people in the world. Everyone was talking about the Taliban. The whole world knew about the Taliban. We brought good to this country. We brought security. Before we came, even a trip to buy groceries was a gamble. People stole, people raped, and no one could say anything.</p> <p>&#x201c;Under our government, you could sleep with the doors open. You could leave your keys in your car, return after a month, and no one would&#x2019;ve touched it.&#x201d;</p> <p>On the battlefield against the Northern Alliance rebels, he had risen quickly in the ranks, first leading a few dozen men, then heading a fifty-man unit, and finally establishing himself as one of the top commanders on the front line. By 2001, he was directing a force of a hundred or so fighters tasked with trekking through the mountains near Gayawa, hunting for rebel sympathizers. He was also chief of police for a district north of Kabul, occasional director of military transportation and logistics, and the sole authority responsible for disarming the population in any newly conquered territories. It was in this last duty that he acquired his nom de guerre, one that, in those days at least, he had carried proudly.</p> <p>For five years, the fighting between his Taliban forces and the Northern Alliance ground on. For every insurgent hamlet put down, it felt as if another sprang up in its place. Then, on September 9, 2001, in the first suicide strike in Afghan history, a pair of young Arab men posing as journalists assassinated Ahmed Shah Massoud, the legendary leader of the Alliance. Rebel forces were thrown into disarray. For the first time, Mullah Cable could sense the prospect of total victory. On September 10, he and other Taliban commanders launched an offensive across the entire front line. By the morning of the eleventh, they had swept into the strategic village of Gayawa.</p> <p>&#x201c;We were on the verge of something great,&#x201d; he recalled, &#x201c;but everything changed after the planes hit. That was the biggest mistake that ever happened to us.&#x201d;</p>&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013; <p></p> <p>Early on the morning of September 12, 2001, in the cracked, war-eaten office building housing Kabul&#x2019;s Foreign Ministry, a few turbaned Taliban officials sat watching the news on a flickering television&#x2014;the only sanctioned set in town, as all moving images had been banned. As they stared at replays of the Twin Towers collapsing into an apocalyptic pile of burning ruins, President George W. Bush&#x2019;s warning flashed across the screen: &#x201c;We will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them.&#x201d;</p> <p>It was a moment some Taliban officials had long feared. To the most pragmatic among them, Osama bin Laden and his retinue of followers had been nothing but trouble since they had landed in 1996. The Arabs of al-Qaeda spoke a different language, practiced a distinct culture, and even followed a different form of Islam from their Afghan counterparts. Bin Laden was waging international jihad to overthrow US global hegemony, while the Taliban were concerned largely with politics within their country&#x2019;s borders. Bin Laden railed against the West, and his acolytes bombed US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, while the Taliban were seeking Western diplomatic recognition. Quickly, America&#x2019;s bin Laden problem had become the Taliban&#x2019;s as well. The two sides met throughout the late 1990s in an attempt to work out a solution, but cultural and political divides proved insurmountable. The Taliban agreed to place bin Laden on trial, but Washington, not trusting the impartiality of Afghan courts, demanded his extradition t...</p></p><h2>Good Neighbors</h2><p>A delightful children&#39;s story teaching tolerance and the value of true friendship.</p><p></p><h2>The Science of Sexy: Dress to Fit Your Unique Figure with the Style System That Works for Every Shapeand Size</h2><p><b>A celebrity fashion designer gives every woman the red-carpet treatment in this foolproof guide to choosing clothes that make you look fabulous?with tailor-made tips for forty-eight body types.</b><br><br> From Oprah to Eva Longoria, top L.A. designer Bradley Bayou has dressed women of all shapes and sizes and knows that every woman has her own natural combination of silhouette shape, height, and weight.

Rebelling against her family&#x2019;s hidebound conservatism, Mitford became an outspoken socialist and, with her second cousin and husband-to-be Esmond Romilly, ran away to fight against Franco in the Spanish Civil War. Romilly was killed in World War II, and Mitford moved to America, where she married the lawyer and political activist Robert Treuhaft. A brilliant muckraking journalist, Mitford was the author of, among other works, a memoir of her youth, <i>Hons and Rebels </i>(also published as an NYRB Classic); a study of the funeral industry, <i>The American Way of Death</i>; and <i>Kind and Unusual Punishment: The Prison Business</i>. She died at the age of seventy-eight while working on a follow-up to <i>The American Way of Death</i>, for which, with characteristic humor, she proposed the title &#x201c;<i>Death Warmed Over</i>.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><i><br></i><br> Jane Smiley, <b>winner of the 1992 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, is the author of many novels and other works.

That she could also make you laugh while exposing the shenanigans of the corrupt, or, as she preferred to call it, muckraking, makes this book indispensable....It is also useful as, and intended to be useful as, a manual for doing the kind of journalism she did. She is very interested in inspiring people to continue the tradition of muckraking, and just because the technology of journalism has changed, it doesn't mean that techniques of getting interviewees to spill beans they would otherwise have preferred unspilled have changed, too. So as well as comments, or post-mortems, on every piece here, there is also an entertaining and helpful introduction in which she goes through the basics of her trade...And you can learn so much from her style, too.&nbsp;Although, it has to be said, there would be many at the receiving end of her attention who would dispute that line about her sweet nature.

Many of the poems have never been published, others only in rare ephemeral publications. Some are&nbsp;explicit, celebrating carnal love as part of the divine. Others are humorous and cover more quotidian subjects. A recurring theme is the &#x201c;divine animal&#x201d; duality. The collection includes poems written from the early fifties up until Kandel&#x2019;s death.<br><br>The paradox of Lenore Kandel is that despite her prodigious talent, she was one of the least read and critically appreciated of modern poets. Kandel found her voice at a time when the Beat era was giving way to the countercultural age, and though she&nbsp;straddled both eras, it meant that she also fell through the cracks in terms of recognition. Now for the first time the full range of her work appears in one volume.</p><p>Lenore Kandel (1932&#x2013;2009) was born in New York City and wrote poetry from childhood.

The English Parliament, in a search for scapegoats, even claimed that the theories found in Leviathan were a likely cause of the Plague of 1665 and the Great Fire of 1666. <p>For the modern reader, though, Hobbes is more recognized for his popular belief that humanity's natural condition is a state of perpetual war, with life being "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short." Despite frequent challenges by other philosophers, Leviathan's secular theory of absolutism no longer stands out as particularly objectionable. In the description of the organization of states, moreover, we see Hobbes as strikingly current in his use of concepts that we still employ today, including the ideas of natural law, natural rights, and the social contract. Based on this work, one could even argue that Hobbes created English-language philosophy, insofar as Leviathan was the first great philosophical work written in English and one whose impact continues to the present day.</p></p><p>Hobbes&#39; Leviathan is arguably the greatest piece of political philosophy written in the English language.

Based primarily on passages in Isaiah 53 and Psalm 22, the reader is led on an exploration of the suffering and sacrifice it took to achieve our salvation, of Christ&#39;s separation from the Father so that we could enjoy intimacy with God, of His desertion so that we&#39;d never have to be alone, of His rejection so that we&#39;d find acceptance, and of His death so that we&#39;d have eternal life. A Violent Grace gives readers a renewed appreciation for God&#39;s eternal love and an important reminder that His love came at a terrible cost.</p><p>Michael Card is a well-known, multi-Dove Award -- winning musician and author whose previous children&#39;s books have been Gold Medallion finalists. He recently launched a weekly radio program heard on over 150 stations. Collectively, his works have sold more than four million copies and his twenty-year music career has seen nineteen number-one songs on the Christian charts. When not producing thought-provoking, soul-stirring albums or performing across the country, Michael can be found at home in Tennessee with his wife, Susan, and their children, Katie, Will, Nathan, and Maggie."With dramatic and cinematic lyrics and riviting prose, we are eyewitnesses, Scripture becomes flesh for us to see and feel and touch, to steph into and experience. Much like Mel Gibson's movie, <em>The Passion</em>, Card's book and CD stop us in our tracks and ask, even demand, a <em>selah</em>. To read through the book and share the life and death of Christ with others during Lent, and then experience the CD as a musical, during Holy Week, would be a truly rewarding and deepening journey for a community of believers." (Andrea Hunter, Worship Leader, March/April 2013)<br><br>"Always the careful teacher, Michael Card draws the church back to a much-needed look at the suffering Savior. Like me, you will gaze with astonished reverence at the One who endured such violence, then bow in humble adoration, crying, 'Lord, make me more like you.'" (Steve Green)<br><br>"What Michael Card sings at this level I most need: The inaudible strains of warm truth that fly from heart to heart and nourish the soul where all too few have fed. Loving God is hungry work and only those who hunger enough can feed the rest of us. Michael Card knows how to set such a table." (Calvin Miller)<br><br>"Dietrich Bonhoeffer defined 'cheap grace' as grace without the cross. In these scalding pages, Michael Card touched my heart with the love of Christ crucified and led me to an unprecedented appreciation of undeserved grace." (Brennan Manning, author of The Ragamuffin Gospel)<br><br>"Every encounter I've had with Michael Card has brought me closer to Jesus. I'm confident that this book will do the same." (Max Lucado)</p><h2>Feng Shaun: Discover Inner Peace with Shaun the Sheep</h2><p>The Academy Award-winning creators of Wallace &amp; Gromit and Chicken Run present a humorous guide to achieving enlightenment and spiritual fulfillment that pairs such advice as "have faith" and "learn tai chi" with photos of characters from the Wallace &amp; Gromit universe acting out each piece of sage wisdom. 25,000 first printing.</p><p>Fans of Wallace and Gromit, get ready: now there's a book to help you naaaaaaaavigate life's spiritual ups and downs!

Its protagonist, Cornelius Suttree, has forsaken his prominent family to live in a dilapidated houseboat among the inhabitants of the demimonde along the banks of the Tennessee River. His associates are mostly criminals of one sort or another, and Suttree is, to say the least, estranged from what might be called normal society. But he is so involved with life (and it with him) that when in the end he takes his leave, the reader&#x2019;s heart goes with him. <i>Suttree</i> is probably the funniest and most unbearably sad of McCarthy&#x2019;s books . . . which seem to me unsurpassed in American literature.&#x201d; &#x2014;Stanley Booth<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>By the author of Blood Meridian and All the Pretty Horses, Suttree is the story of Cornelius Suttree, who has forsaken a life of privilege with his prominent family to live in a dilapidated houseboat on the Tennessee River near Knoxville.

In the &#x201c;fascinating&#x201d; (<i>Booklist</i>, starred review) <i>A Self-Made Man</i>, Sidney Blumenthal reveals how Lincoln&#x2019;s antislavery thinking began in his childhood in backwoods Kentucky and Indiana. Intensely ambitious, he held political aspirations from his earliest years. Yet he was a socially awkward suitor who had a nervous breakdown over his inability to deal with the opposite sex. His marriage to the upper class Mary Todd was crucial to his social aspirations and his political career. &#x201c;The Lincoln of Blumenthal&#x2019;s pen is...a brave progressive facing racist assaults on his religion, ethnicity, and very legitimacy that echo the anti-Obama birther movement....Blumenthal takes the wily pol of Steven Spielberg&#x2019;s <i>Lincoln</i> and Doris Kearns Goodwin&#x2019;s <i>Team of Rivals</i> and goes deeper, finding a Vulcan logic and <i>House of Cards</i> ruthlessness&#x201d; (<i>The Washingtonian</i>).<br> <br>Based on prodigious research of Lincoln&#x2019;s record, and of the period and its main players, Blumenthal&#x2019;s robust biography reflects both Lincoln&#x2019;s time and the struggle that consumes our own political debate. This first volume traces Lincoln from his birth in 1809 through his education in the political arts, rise to the Congress, and fall into the wilderness from which he emerged as the man we recognize as Abraham Lincoln. &#x201c;Splendid...no one can come away from reading <i>A Self-Made Man...</i>without eagerly anticipating the ensuing volumes.&#x201d; (<i>Washington Monthly</i>).</p><p>Sidney Blumenthal&nbsp;is the acclaimed author of&nbsp;<i>A Self-Made Man</i> and <i>Wrestling with His Angel</i>, the first two volumes in his five-volume biography,&nbsp;<i>The Political Life of Abraham Lincoln</i>.

Reissue.</p><p>"Eddie Lee Sexton is evil incarnate. Like Charles Manson, he exercised a cult-like mind control over others who did his dirty work. But unlike Manson, both Sexton's victims and his subjects were his very own flesh and blood." As strong as they are, these words from an assistant district attorney barely hint at the depravity hidden for years within the Sexton family. Strange notions about "Futuretrons" and hand markings that convey absolute power, revelations of incest and physical abuse, bodies buried in the camping area of a Florida state park--<i> House of Secrets</i> has so many layers of weirdness that it will amaze even seasoned readers of true crime. Lowell Cauffiel has a talent for combining quotations from interviews and unembellished facts into prose that reads like a novel. Two people are dead, and the children who suffered the cruel fate of being born into the Sexton family may never completely heal from their injuries--but at least their story has been told.<b>Lowell Cauffiel&nbsp;</b>is an American true crime author, novelist, and TV producer.

Written with exclusive access to Musk, his family and friends, the book traces the entrepreneur's journey from a rough upbringing in South Africa to the pinnacle of the global business world. Vance spent more than 30 hours in conversation with Musk and interviewed close to 300 people to tell the tumultuous stories of Musk's world-changing companies: PayPal, Tesla Motors, SpaceX and SolarCity, and to characterize a man who has renewed American industry and sparked new levels of innovation while making plenty of enemies along the way. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vance uses Musk's story to explore one of the pressing questions of our time: can the nation of inventors and creators which led the modern world for a century still compete in an age of fierce global competition? He argues that Musk--one of the most unusual and striking figures in American business history--is a contemporary amalgam of legendary inventors and industrialists like Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Howard Hughes, and Steve Jobs. More than any other entrepreneur today, Musk has dedicated his energies and his own vast fortune to inventing a future that is as rich and far-reaching as the visionaries of the golden age of science-fiction fantasy.</p><p>There are few industrialists in history who could match Elon Musk's relentless drive and ingenious vision. A modern alloy of Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Howard Hughes, and Steve Jobs, Musk is the man behind PayPal, Tesla Motors, SpaceX, and SolarCity, each of which has sent shock waves throughout American business and industry. More than any other executive today, Musk has dedicated his energies and his own vast fortune to inventing a future that is as rich and far-reaching as a science fiction fantasy. <br><br>In this lively, investigative account, veteran technology journalist Ashlee Vance offers an unprecedented look into the remarkable life and times of Silicon Valley's most audacious businessman. Written with exclusive access to Musk, his family, and his friends, the book traces his journey from his difficult upbringing in South Africa to his ascent to the pinnacle of the global business world. Vance spent more than fifty hours in conversation with Musk and inter- viewed close to three hundred people to tell the tumultuous stories of Musk's world-changing companies and to paint a portrait of a complex man who has renewed American industry and sparked new levels of innovation--all while making plenty of enemies along the way. <br><br>In 1992, Elon Musk arrived in the United States as a ferociously driven immigrant bent on realizing his wildest dreams. Since then, Musk's roller-coaster life has brought him grave disappointments alongside massive successes. After being forced out of PayPal, fending off a life-threatening case of malaria, and dealing with the death of his infant son, Musk abandoned Silicon Valley for Los Angeles. He spent the next few years baffling his friends by blowing his entire fortune on rocket ships and electric cars. Cut to 2012, however, and Musk had mounted one of the greatest resurrections in business history: Tesla, SpaceX, and SolarCity had enjoyed unparalleled success, and Musk's net worth soared to more than $5 billion. <br><br>At a time when many American companies are more interested in chasing easy money than in taking bold risks on radical new technology, Musk stands out as the only businessman with enough dynamism and vision to tackle--and even revolutionize--three industries at once. Vance makes the case that Musk's success heralds a return to the original ambition and invention that made America an economic and intellectual powerhouse. <i>Elon Musk</i> is a brilliant, penetrating examination of what Musk's career means for a technology industry undergoing dramatic change and offers a taste of what could be an incredible century ahead."Ashlee Vance has given us an intensely reported, wonderfully spirited account of Elon Musk's rise to the pinnacle of the business world. This is the definitive look at the man who may have the biggest impact on the human race. Should Musk bring humanity to Mars, this will be the planet's founding document." -- BRAD STONE, author of the bestselling <i>The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon</i><br><br> "Elon Musk is a man after my own heart: a risk taker undaunted by setbacks and ever driven to ensure a bright future for humanity. Ashlee Vance's stellar biography captures Musk's remarkable life story and irrepressible spirit." -- RICHARD BRANSON, founder of Virgin Group <br><br>"More than any entrepreneur since Steve Jobs, Elon Musk sets the bar for what's possible in technology. We are fortunate to have our very own real-life Tony Stark in Elon, and here, for the first time, we have his story vividly told." --MARC ANDREESSEN, venture capitalist and Web pioneer <br><br>"Ashlee Vance offers a clear-eyed look at a man who has played the underdog again and again--challenging old thinking and changing the world. I dare anyone to read this book and not be inspired to set their sights a little higher." --TONY FADELL, creator of the iPod and iPhone, and CEO of Nest Labs <br><br>"Elon Musk is one of the greatest entrepreneurial minds of our time. His combination of extreme intelligence, relentless drive, and steadfast belief in his bold ideas is ensuring that all of society has the chance to benefit from his efforts. The book <i>Elon Musk</i> is a compelling firsthand, behind-the-scenes look at how Tesla, SpaceX, and SolarCity were formed, and how Elon works to bring his passions to fruition. He is a unique character changing the world, and Ashlee Vance's book is a riveting account of how Elon's game-changing ideas have been conceived and born, and now flourish." --J. CRAIG VENTER, Ph.D., first human genome sequencer and creator of synthetic life <br><br>"This thrilling book will make you want to start a car company, build spaceships, and go to Mars. The only downside is when you eventually remember that you're not Elon Musk." -- AARON LEVIE, CEO of Box<i></i></p><h2>Mark Bittman&#39;s Kitchen Express: 404 inspired seasonal dishes you can make in 20 minutes or less</h2><p>101 super-quick and ultra-easy recipes for each of the four seasons&#x2014;totaling a whopping 404 recipes&#x2014;from award-winning cookbook author and popular <i>New York Times</i> columnist Mark Bittman.<br><br>� A celebrated author with a huge following: The author of the perennial bestseller <i>How to Cook Everything</i>, mark Bittman is known across the country as &#x201c;The minimalist.&#x201d; His more than two million readers eagerly follow his weekly recipes and accompanying instructional online videos from <i>The New York Times</i>.

His work has appeared in countless newspapers and magazines, and he is a regular on the <i>Today</i> show. Mr. Bittman has hosted two public television series and has appeared in a third.<b></b><p><b>Introduction</b></p><p>The simple format of <i>Kitchen Express</i> belies all that it has to offer. Here are 101 incredibly fast and easy recipes for each season -- 404 in all. The experienced home cook can play with each to great advantage, yet at their core, they're recipes presented in the simplest form possible, understandable and readily executed by anyone who's done some cooking.</p><p>As a group, they are precisely imprecise. This is unusual for recipes, but it's long been my belief that the most specific recipes are the most limiting. Specificity is fine for baking, where the chemistry among the ingredients often determines success or failure. But in savory cooking, where amounts can vary wildly -- there's almost never a critical difference between one onion and two: A "head" of broccoli might weigh one or one-and-a-half pounds; a steak may be three-quarters to an inch and a half thick -- to try to force cooks to follow recipes demanding precision robs them of the ability to improvise, to relax, to substitute, to use their own judgment.</p><p>Jacques Pepin once remarked to me that the old adage about never stepping foot in the same river twice holds true for recipes also: You don't start with the same amount of ingredients, they're not at the same temperature, they're not the same age or from the same place, the ambient temperature and humidity are probably different, as are your equipment and mood. Everything is different, and the results will be too.</p><p>These little recipes acknowledge that up front. I don't really care how much garlic you use in most recipes, so "some" is as good as "a teaspoon." Similarly, garnishes are garnishes: You use more, you use less, you leave them out -- it shouldn't matter. "A carrot" in a soup could certainly be a big one or a small one, and so on. So I rarely give exact measurements, unless proportions are critical.</p><p>This style of cooking is about three things: speed, flexibility, and relaxation. If you read one of these recipes, if it inspires you, and if you have the ingredients (or something approximating them) to throw it together -- then go into the kitchen, assemble what you need, and have at it. Twenty minutes later, max, you'll be eating something delicious. What's wrong with that?Copyright � 2009 by Mark Bittman</p></p><h2>Christmas: Penhaligon&#39;s Scented Treasury of Verse and Prose</h2><p>This book captures all the splendor of Christmas.

So when an enormous white bear mysteriously shows up and asks her to come away with him--in exchange for health and prosperity for her ailing family--she readily agrees. The bear takes Rose to a distant castle, where each night she is confronted with a mystery. In solving that mystery, she loses her heart, discovers her purpose, and realizes her travels have only just begun.<br> As familiar and moving as "Beauty and the Beast" and yet as fresh and original as only the best fantasy can be, <i>East</i> is a novel retelling of the classic tale "East of the Sun, West of the Moon," a sweeping romantic epic in the tradition of Robin McKinley and Gail Carson Levine.<br></p><p>In the rural villages of Norway, there is an ancient belief that children inherit the qualities of the direction in which they are born. Nymah Rose, the last daughter of eight siblings born to a poor mapmaker and his superstitious wife, was a North-born baby. It is said that North-born babies are wild, unpredictable, intelligent, and destined to break their mothers' hearts because they all leave hearth and home to travel to the far ends of the earth. To keep her close, Rose&#x2019;s mother lied and told her she had been born of the obedient and pliable East. But destiny cannot be denied. One day, a great white bear comes to the mapmaker&#x2019;s door to claim Rose&#x2019;s birthright. Everything that comes after, as richly imagined by author Edith Pattou, is the basis for one of the most epic romantic fantasies ever told. <i>East</i> is a deftly woven tapestry that melds traditional fairy tale motifs of both <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> and <i>East of the Sun and West of the Moon</i>, with the haunting icy lore of medieval northern lands. Told in a changing chorus of voices, including that of Rose, her hopeful brother Neddy, her regretful father, the charmed white bear, and the Troll Queen whose selfish wish is the catalyst that seals Rose&#x2019;s fate, <i>East</i> will enchant any and all who venture within its pages. It is a tale for the Ages, and for all ages. Highly recommended.

Such famous politicians, writers, artists, and musicians as Winston Churchill, George Frederick Handel, Lord Byron, Virginia Woolf, Edgar Allan Poe, Napoleon Bonaparte, and Vincent van Gogh had bipolar disorder, but most persons affected by bipolar disorder are just ordinary people who want nothing more than to get back to their everyday lives after they or their family members have been diagnosed with the illness. This book is written for them." -- from the Preface</p><p>In this book for persons with bipolar disorder and their families, Dr. Frank Mondimore offers a comprehensive, practical, compassionate guide to the symptoms, diagnosis, treatment and causes of this potentially devastating psychiatric illness, formerly known as "manic-depression." He offers practical advice for getting the most out of the various treatments that are now available -- from medication, psychotherapy, and electroconvulsive treatment to new approaches such as St. John's wort and transcranial magnetic stimulation. For each, he discusses advantages, disadvantages, side effects, and other information to help patients make informed decisions about treatment options. He also describes what it is like to live with bipolar disorder and discusses how lifestyle changes can improve quality of life. Throughout, he focuses on the importance of building a support system, of planning for emergencies, and of giving one's self permission to seek help.</p><p>Bipolar disorder is a particularly difficult illness to diagnose and treat, Dr. Mondimore acknowledges, and it can be incredibly destructive to relationships and careers, can wreak havoc on family life and, when not properly treated, is a potentially fatal disease. In his wide-ranging discussion of this unpredictable disorder, Dr. Mondimore describes problems that are unique to women, whose disease may be affected by the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and childbirth,. He includes new information on the forms the illness takes in children and adolescents, in whom it can sometimes be mistaken for more common problems such as "hyperactivity" or Attention Deficit Disorder. He explains what we know about the genetics of the disease, how symptoms fluctuate with the seasons in seasonal affective disorder, and how illness can be made more difficult to treat because of alcoholism or drug abuse. He discusses coping with the stigmatization of psychiatric diagnosis, gives advice on picking a psychiatrist and on dealing with medical insurance issues, and even explores the fascinating relationship between bipolar disorder and artistic creativity. Finally, Dr. Mondimore tells family members what they can do to help the person with bipolar disorder -- and themselves -- and he offers hope for the future as researchers learn more about the disease and how to control it.</p></p><p><p>Francis Mark Mondimore, M.D., is a psychiatrist and member of the clinical faculty of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. His books include Depression: The Mood Disease and Adolescent Depression: A Guide for Parents, both available from Johns Hopkins.</p>paper 0-8018-6118-7 An exhaustive, scientific, yet compassionate assist for sufferers of ``the chameleon of psychiatric disorders'' and their families. Psychiatrist Mondimore (Univ. of North Carolina, Chapel Hill) looks first at the symptoms and diagnosis of bipolar disorder, or manic-depression: the disease wears many masks that can make diagnosis difficult. Mondimore concedes that at present psychiatrists are generally working with the same diagnostic tools that were used in the 19th century: their eyes and ears. He goes on to discuss treatment. Medications are first and foremostprimarily mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and antipsychotics. He follows with a thoughtful considerations of electroconvulsive therapy, counseling, and psychotherapy. Mondimore is especially clear on medication side effects (and how to avoid them), how various treatments have been used and misused, and what a reasonable standard should be. In part three, Mondimore considers how bipolar disorder affects children, adolescents, and women; and how it is affected by alcoholism and drug abuse, seasonal affective disorder and chronobiology, genetics, and other medical conditions such as stroke and hormonal problems. In part four, Mondimore offers real, detailed help for living with the disease. The key is to recognize that bipolar disease is relentless and that the way to keep it at bay is for the patient to be relentless, tooabout getting needed treatment and sticking to it''. Illustrative case studies here make it clear this can be done, but it isn't easy. An absolute gold mine, then, for those with the disorder and their families: thorough, candid, and up-to-date advice, full of new possibilities for help. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Unbinding the Gospel: Real Life Evangelism is a book for pastors who want to know the truth about the state of evangelism. Recently selected by The Christian Century as a featured "Take and Read" book (2007 book issue), Unbinding the Gospel is a book for Christians who want a hopeful, powerful, joy-filled way to learn to share their faith. (It's also a book for people who cringe when they hear the "E" word!) This book for congregational use has been enthusiastically endorsed by 8 heads of denominations, Brian McLaren, Richard Peace, as well as by countless pastors and church leaders. Unbinding the Gospel, 2nd ed. is the foundation of the Unbinding the Gospel Series, which can lead to a six-week, all-congregation saturation study with individual prayer, small group study and all-church worship and prayer dimensions. See Unbinding Your Heart (the 6 week version of GOSPEL, with a different 40 day prayer journal) and Unbinding Your Church (the Pastor's Guide).

Humor, whimsy and joy in the faith will serve us better. Reese's book is written to provoke, to tease and to charm us back into telling our story." <br><i><b>The Christian Century</b></i> <br><br> "...with clarity and sound theological grounding, we are invited into a grand adventure....could be a watershed book for mainline Protestantism." <br><b>Alban Institute, <i>Congregations</i></b> <br><br> "...Reese's book is so important...That's why when you turn the last page, you can't just let this be another book you read. You need to let her message affect you and your faith community, and through you, other people." <br><b>Brian McLaren</b> <br><br> "I expect the <i><b>Real Life Evangelism Series</b></i> to move at least 20,000 churches into their first invitational foray into the community in anyone's memory."<br> <b>George G.

Anyone who cares about and works in the cause of mainline evangelism will find this book a treasure." <br><b>Todd Hunter, National Director, Alpha USA; Former Director, Vineyard Churches USA </b>"<i>Unbinding the Gospel</i> is a power pack! Based on the extensive and authoritative research of Martha Grace Reese, and rooted in her passionate love for God and respect for the mainline church, this book provides the most competent guide I know to mainline evangelism. <i>Unbinding the Gospel</i>, like Reese, is the rarest of gifts. She does the extraordinary: she removes guilt and lack of confidence regarding evangelism with the whole story, honest interpretation and with fresh, non-judgmental and kind insights for change. <i>Unbinding the Gospel</i> is realistic, clear and direct; but also hopeful, humble and genuinely spiritual. Anyone who cares about and works in the cause of mainline evangelism will find this book a treasure."<br> --Todd Hunter, National Director, Alpha USA; Former Director, Vineyard Churches USA <br><br> "This new interesting book on the "E word" (Evangelism), based on studies of 150 churches and interviews with over 1000 people, will be a breath of fresh air in thousands of congregations. As I read it, other "E" words came to mind--like engaging, encouraging, energetic, and even entrepreneurial and exhilarating."<br> --George G. Hunter, Distinguished Professor of Evangelization, Asbury Theological Seminary <br><br> "Martha Grace Reese gently but persistently lures the Mainline back to the ministry of evangelism that is the heart of the church. Based on careful research and extensive listening, <i>Unbinding the Gospel</i> avoids gimmicks and the trap of the latest church growth fad, inviting pastors and members instead to a relationship with Christ that overflows the banks of our often cautious and reserved congregations. Filled with helpful suggestions for getting started, this book can convert even the most `evangelism-cautious' Christians into eager disciples who love others enough to tell them why Jesus is the answer."<br> -- John H. Thomas, General Minister and President, United Church of Christ <br><br> "<i>Unbinding the Gospel</i> should be required reading in all mainline churches. Our continuing existence may depend upon it."<br> -- Richard Peace, Professor of Evangelism and Spiritual Formation, Fuller Theological Seminary <br><br> "I am delighted with the publication of <i>Unbinbing the Gospel: Real Life Evangelism</i> by Martha Grace Reese. It is just the kind of challenge we need in the mainline Protestant Churches today! God is calling us to a deeper relationship to Jesus Christ and a fresh passion to share our faith with others. This book is a marvelous resource for mainline Christians and congregations to gain fresh perspectives on sharing the Good News and building the church in our time! I heartily recommend this book!"<br> --Clifton Kirkpatrick, Stated Clerk of the General Assembly, Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) <br><br> "<i>Unbinding the Gospel: Real Life Evangelism</i>, by Martha Grace Reese, is a down to earth, engaging, fun and compelling call to mainline congregations and disciples to reclaim the "e" word....evangelism... with very practical and personal advise on sharing your faith, today!"<br> --David Schoen, Congregational Vitality Initiative Coordinator, Evangelism Minister and Team Leader, Local Church Ministries <br><br> "Written with intelligence, heart and a sense of humor, this book is brimming with love for God and for Gods children. It is equally inspiration, motivation and how to. This is real life evangelism for real life Christians."<br> --Sharon Watkins, General Minister and President, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) <br><br> "Reese loves the Church. Remember that, as you digest her study of American mainline churches and their seeming impotence over the "E" word. Momentarily citing statistics to the point of shock and awe, she doesn't leave the reader there. Hope for the mainline church abounds in these pages. She carefully demythologizes evangelism and then reconstructs it through common sense practices."<br> --Jim Griffith, President of Griffith Coaching Network <br><br> "<i>Unbinding the Gospel</i> looks at the 'brutal facts' of evangelism in the mainline churches with a passionate and inspiring vision of how churches can nurture evangelistic engagement in the culture today. The real stories it tells deepen a credible hope. We long today for a missional, relational, incarnational expression of the church's life in our society. This book helps to identify the pathways toward that future. It's a book that teaches us how to re-learn the practice of evangelism, published at a teachable moment. Don't just read this book--use it!"<br> --Wesley Granberg-Michaelson, General Secretary, Reformed Church in America <br><br> "There is nothing quite like solid research to dispel the sort of misconceptions and self-serving biases and attitudes we of mainline churches have harbored for so long. Solid research is what Gay Reese gives us, along with clear, thoughtful analysis and concrete prescriptions for how we can move forward in faithful and effective evangelism. She manages to do all this in a book that is completely accessible to both clergy and lay people and fun to read! It is an amazing and timely accomplishment!"<br> --Richard L. Hamm, former General Minister and President of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and author of <i>Recreating the Church: Leadership for the Postmodern Age</i> <br><br> "This book combines research and hard data with warm stories of real people growing their churches in healthy ways. The anecdotal material inspires each of us as followers of Jesus to grow more comfortable in sharing our faith. But as important is the research that informs our church leaders about congregational dynamics that impact the growth or stagnation of our churches. Reese has put together an approach to sharing the gospel that works in main line denominational churches. We are using this book as the primary resource for our elders in an upcoming leadership retreat."<br>--Bruce Humphrey, Senior Pastor, Rancho Bernardo Community Presbyterian Church, San Diego, California</p><h2>Staffordshire Romantic Transfer Patterns: Cup Plates and Early Victorian China</h2><p>This is a big book -- 763 pp!

This survivor (a legal client of the first author and a therapy client of the second author) takes the reader on a remarkable odyssey. Her narrative brings the IFS model to life. Reading her story we learn how the human psyche overcomes even the most severe traumas and emotional injuries. From the IFS perspective, the survivor&#39;s symptoms - the inability to trust anyone, the compulsive self-soothing or self-punishment, the pervasive sense of shame and badness, the hidden rage - are all seen not as symptoms of psychopathology, but as heroic efforts by warring subpersonalities to protect the core Self from the destructive effects of the abuse. The authors provide guidelines for accessing this core Self, undamaged in even the most severely abused individuals.

The removal of the normally dense ground cover revealed enough evidence to suggest that an archaeological survey would be fruitful and perhaps could address some unanswered questions about the battle.</p><p>Describing archaeological investigations during the first year (1984) of a two-year survey, this book offers a detailed analysis of the physical evidence remaining after the battle. Precise information regarding the locations of artifacts and painstaking analyses of the artifacts themselves have uncovered much new information about the guns used in the battle by the victorious Indian warriors. Not only have the types of guns been identified, but through the use of archaeological and criminal-investigative techniques the actual numbers of firearms can now be estimated. This analysis of the battlefield, which represents a significant advance in methodology, shows that the two forces left artifacts in what can be defined as "combatant patterns."</p><p>What did happen after Custer&#x2019;s trumpeter, John Martin-dispatched with an order for Captain Benteen to "be quick"-turned and saw the doomed battalion for the last time?

The creators of our democracy had both the temptations and the shortcomings of all men, combined with the talents and idealism of the truly great. Among them, no Founding Father demonstrates the combination of temptations and talents quite so vividly as the least known of the greats, Gouverneur Morris. <br> His story is one that should be known by every American -- after all, he drafted the Constitution, and his hand lies behind many of its most important phrases. Yet he has been lost in the shadows of the Founders who became presidents and faces on our currency. As Brookhiser shows in this sparkling narrative, Morris's story is not only crucial to the Founding, it is also one of the most entertaining and instructive of all. Gouverneur Morris, more than Washington, Jefferson, or even Franklin, is the Founding Father whose story can most readily touch our hearts, and whose character is most sorely needed today. <br> He was a witty, peg-legged ladies' man. He was an eyewitness to two revolutions (American and French) who joked with George Washington, shared a mistress with Talleyrand, and lost friends to the guillotine. In his spare time he gave New York City its street grid and New York State the Erie Canal. His keen mind and his light, sure touch helped make our Constitution the most enduring fundamental set of laws in the world. In his private life, he suited himself; pleased the ladies until, at age fifty-seven, he settled down with one lady (and pleased her); and lived the life of a gentleman, for whom grace and humanity were as important as birth. He kept his good humor through war, mobs, arson, death, and two accidents that burned the flesh from one of his arms and cut off one of his legs below the knee. <br> Above all, he had the gift of a sunny disposition that allowed him to keep his head in any troubles. We have much to learn from him, and much pleasure to take in his company.</p><p><b>Richard Brookhiser</b> is the author of <i>America's First Dynasty: The Adamses, 1735-1918</i> (2002), <i>Alexander Hamilton, American</i> (1999), <i>Founding Father: Rediscovering George Washington</i> (1995), and <i>The Way of the WASP</i> (1991), all published by Free Press.

He contributes to such publications as <i>The Atlantic Monthly, American Heritage,</i> and <i>The New York Times.</i> He lives in New York City.<i>Introduction</i><br><br>A biographer can feel a moment's hesitation when it comes to introducing his subject, for every traditional means has its drawbacks. If the hero appears <i>in medias res,</i> in the midst of some great action, the reader may feel manipulated, even coerced: his attention is being claimed before it has been earned. If the story of a life begins where the life does, in a cradle, then the reader might experience a sense of delay: he wished to read about great men, not infants. For the biographer of Gouverneur Morris, it is perhaps best to let him be introduced by a woman.<br><br>In 1795, Harriet de Damas, a French countess, wrote a portrait of a tall, handsome American who had become a fixture of Parisian society.1 Gouverneur Morris had come to France in 1789, age thirty-seven, as a businessman; three years later, he was appointed the American minister to that country. Mr. Morris had a French first name (his mother's maiden name), which Americans insisted on pronouncing "Gov-er-<i>neer";</i> he had learned French as a child, and wrote it well enough to produce papers on French politics, or little poems for his friends. Mme de Damas called his spoken French "always correct and vigorous," though other Frenchwomen teased him for his mistakes. Mr. Morris cut a figure for many reasons: his impressive bearing (the French sculptor Jean-Antoine Houdon used him as a body double for a statue of George Washington); his wit; his severely elegant clothes and carriage, so different from French silks and colors; and what was severe in a different way, his wooden left leg. When he arrived at a party, the servants watched him; the guests watched him; he watched himself, mindful of the impression he made.<br><br>"Superficial observers," wrote Mme de Damas, "...might be acquainted with Mr. Morris for years, without discovering his most eminent qualities. Such observers must be told what to admire." The Frenchwoman confronts a difficulty with her portrait head-on: she had known Mr. Morris for only a small part of his life, since his first thirty-seven years had been spent in America. But she plunged ahead confidently.<br><br>The superficial observers of his early life "regard Mr. Morris as a profound politician," and indeed he had been involved in politics, often of the most eventful kind. When he was twenty-three years old the American Revolution began, and he watched it pull society and family asunder (one of his elder half brothers signed the Declaration of Independence; another half brother was a general in the British army). He left American towns a step ahead of marauding British armies, and when Morris visited his mother, who supported the crown throughout the war, he had to get passes from both sides to cross their lines. He eventually followed his patriot half brother into the Continental Congress, where he helped accomplish great things, but also engaged in endless petty wrangling. ("We had many scoundrels" in Congress, he would remember as an older man.)<br><br>When he was still a young one, age thirty-five, Mr. Morris drafted the Constitution of the United States. The proceedings of the Constitutional Convention were secret, to allow the delegates maximum freedom to speak their minds, so Mr. Morris's role on the Committee of Style was not generally known. But in later years he admitted to a correspondent that "that instrument was written by the fingers which write this letter." Years after Morris's death, an elderly James Madison told an inquiring historian that "the <i>finish</i> given to the style and arrangement of the Constitution fairly belongs to the pen of Mr. Morris." James Madison, the careful and learned theorist, is commonly called the Father of the Constitution, because he kept the most complete set of notes of the debates, and made cogent arguments for ratification after the debates were done (he wrote one third of the <i>Federalist Papers).</i> But Gouverneur Morris, who put the document into its final form and who wrote the Preamble from scratch, also deserves a share of the paternity. The founders were voluminous writers, and much of their writing is very good, but few of them had the combination of lightness and force that generates a great style. Jefferson had it; Franklin had it; Thomas Paine, the passionate and ungainly English immigrant, had it. The only other one of their number who hit that note consistently was Morris. "A better choice" for a draftsman "could not have been made," Madison concluded.<br><br>Mme de Damas and her French friends certainly knew about Mr. Morris's political activity: it was one facet of his social cachet, a point of interest like his wardrobe and his leg. A more striking feature of their friend was his manner. Mme de Damas called him "the most amiable" of men. "His imagination inclines to pleasantry, and being abundantly gifted with what the English call <i>humor,</i> united to what the French name <i>esprit,</i> it is impossible not to be delighted...." Humor and <i>esprit:</i> Mr. Morris delighted in the incongruities and follies of life, including his own, and his comments -- quick, shapely, and bold -- communicated that delight to others. Women found him especially pleasing, perhaps because he took special pains to please them. "Govr Morris kept us in a continual smile," was how one young lady put it. His women friends did more than smile. At the cardtable of the sexes, his wit and looks always trumped his disability, and the one-legged American left a trail of lovers on two continents.<br><br>Mr. Morris's good company went beyond good times. When the French Revolution, more stressful than the American, began to suck his glittering friends into poverty, exile, and danger, he gave many of them refuge, and saved several of their lives. Mme de Damas was not one of his lovers, but he did save her life.<br><br>But more important than Mr. Morris's career or his behavior was his nature. "Nothing really worthy of him," wrote Mme de Damas, "will be said by any one, who does not ascend to the source of all that is great and excellent in his character." That, she decided, was "a belief that God can will nothing but what is good." This gave him confidence, charity, and hope. "Ever at peace with himself...seldom ruffled in his temper, not suffering men or events to have a mastery over his spirit, he is habitually serene, alike ready to engage in the most abstruse inquiries, or to join in the trifles of social amusement." Gouverneur Morris took his life as it came. "He conceives it to be following the order of Providence to enjoy all its gifts. 'To enjoy is to obey.' And upon the same principle he submits, with a modest fortitude, and sincere resignation, to the ills inflicted by the same hand." Living among tottering thrones and shaky republics, Mr. Morris showed the gift of poise.<br><br>Gouverneur Morris belonged to that band of brothers that we now call the founding fathers. Some were his friends: he knew and worshipped George Washington for almost twenty years; he knew and squabbled with Paine for almost as long; he was at Alexander Hamilton's deathbed. Some of them were enemies: he thought James Madison was a fool and a drunkard. He knew them all, and was one of their number. The founding fathers-to-be were guided by the pursuit of greatness. They measured themselves by their service to the country they were making. Mr. Morris was moved by the same tidal pull of public good. "This is the seed time of glory," he wrote in one of his sweetest phrases. The second half of his life, after Mme de Damas finished her portrait, had two great public occasions in store for him. He was one of those New Yorkers who pushed early and hard for what became the Erie Canal, a project that made the paper structure of national union economically vital. At the same time, and paradoxically, he was one of those northerners who decided, during the War of 1812, that the nation should be broken up, and the Constitution scrapped. Other Americans would come to the same conclusion, from abolitionists calling the Constitution a deal with the devil to southerners arguing that it gave them a right to secede. But Morris's abandonment of the document he had written is more astonishing than later repudiations.<br><br>Yet Mr. Morris, alone among the founding fathers, thought that his private life was as important as his public life. Being a gentleman mattered as much to him as being a great man. When public life was not going well, he could go home -- not to bide his time before his next opportunity, or to enjoy the retirement on a pedestal of a Cincinnatus, but because he enjoyed farming, reading, eating, fishing, making money, and making love as much as founding a state. "A characteristic trait, which I must not forget," wrote Mme de Damas, "is his faculty and habit of applying his mind to a single object, of suddenly collecting the whole force of his attention upon one point." That point might be a stumbling economy, or an imperfect constitution; it might also be the parade of domestic life. "He is fond of his ease, does his best to procure it, and enjoys it as much as possible. He loves good cheer, good wine, good company." Mr. Morris's ability to switch from public to private life -- his inability ever to banish his private frame of reference, even in the midst of public business -- did limit his effectiveness as a public man. He lacked the persistence of the other founders. He could focus on one political idea, but soon he might be focusing on another. One delegate to the Constitutional Convention called him "fickle and inconstant," a charge that rang down the years. But this limitation brought benefits. In an era when American politics was as poisonous as it would ever be, he was remarkably free from rancor. Though a war would finally drive him to it, once the war ended, rancor receded. Even James Madison could not long disturb his peace of mind.<br><br>Mr. Morris had many reasons to be happy. He was born to privilege, he worked hard to make himself rich, and he was successful in politics, business, and love: after all his affairs, he married a devoted and intelligent woman (accused, it is true, of being a double murderess, though the accuser, her brother-in-law, was commonly supposed to be somewhat insane). But Mr. Morris also saw many things that could have made him gloomy, bitter, perplexed. He witnessed two revolutions, up close and on the ground, one more turbulent than we remember, the other as turbulent as any has ever been. He fled a town that was about to be burned to the ground, and he saw a corpse that had just been torn apart by a mob. His own body was not only missing a leg, but most of the flesh of one arm. Pessimists and misanthropes have been made of less.<br><br>In 1936, as Europe slid to war, William Butler Yeats wrote that there is a gaiety in art, even tragic art, that transfigures the dread of life. Gouverneur Morris was no artist, unless living is an art. He carried his gaiety within himself. It was, we might say, constitutional.<br><br>Copyright � 2003 by Richard Brookhiser</p><h2>Clarence Darrow: Attorney for the Damned</h2><p><b>Drawing on untapped archives and full of fresh revelations, here is the definitive biography of America&#x2019;s legendary defense attorney and progressive hero.<br><br></b>Clarence Darrow is the lawyer every law school student dreams of being: on the side of right, loved by many women, played by Spencer Tracy in <i>Inherit the Wind</i>.

In the six years since he arrived in Chicago, he had carved a fine niche. The mayor and governor asked his advice. The newspapers covered his speeches. He had taken a real estate dispute to the Illinois Supreme Court and won his client a $500,000 award that, so large for its time, got front- page attention. He had a pleasant house, a proper wife, influential friends, and a son he loved. As first assistant counsel to a mighty railroad, he had a salary and social standing to be envied by the city&#x2019;s glut of aspiring lawyers: dire, sepulchral figures, languishing in the courts, longing for the stroke of fortune that would land them such a choice position.<br><br>Darrow had just turned thirty-six. He was a tall man for his time, with high cheekbones and a formidable brow that could give him the look of a young Lincoln: no disadvantage in Illinois. His eyes were a soft blue and his smile, a law partner would recall, was &#x201c;wreathed in good nature and irresistible charm.&#x201d; He had a kind of rough charisma that, he was discovering, charmed the pretty girls who attended his talks and lectures.<br><br>Small-town Ohio could not hold him and so he had come to Chicago, to the flickering gaslight, the smoke and cinder, the clamor and hoot and honk of that most American city. He had applied himself, in the courts by day and by making the rounds of political clubs and debating societies in the evenings. And he had sought as mentors rich and famous men, and had prospered from their interest. If Darrow sought a template for success, he needed look no further than his boss and patron, the railroad&#x2019;s general counsel, whose office was next to his in the law department at Fifth Avenue and Lake Street, in downtown Chicago.<br><br>William C. Goudy was a trailblazer in a new specialty of the industrial age: the &#x201c;corporation lawyer.&#x201d; With his bearded chin and stern demeanor, Goudy looked like an Amish elder, and though friends insisted that he had a warm heart, he was cold and direct in his professional affairs. He was said to be a millionaire, and Darrow knew him as &#x201c;ultra conservative.&#x201d; As a chieftain of the Illinois &#x201c;silk- stocking&#x201d; Democrats, Goudy served as an adviser to President Grover Cleveland, who had just been elected to a second term, and who shared his corporate sympathies. &#x201c;No harm shall come to any business interest as the result of administrative policy so long as I am President,&#x201d; Cleveland boasted. Goudy was a close friend, as well, of Chief Justice Melville Fuller, a Chicagoan who led the era&#x2019;s notoriously conservative Supreme Court, known for decisions shielding monopolies and trusts, outlawing the income tax, and, in the infamous <i>Plessy v. Ferguson</i>, authorizing racial segregation.<br><br>In the Gilded Age, when the interests of politicians and industrialists ran in tandem&#x2014;or could be made to do so with a timely payoff&#x2014;Goudy&#x2019;s political ties enhanced his appeal to the clients who secured his services. He represented the Vanderbilt railroad empire, the great Armour meatpacking firm, and other powerful interests in their wars against government regulation. It was said that Congress passed the Interstate Commerce Act in part to counteract Goudy, who so ably promoted the rights of corporations and monopolists to run their affairs as they saw fit, without regard to the public interest.<br><br>Goudy and the railroad were, this day, engaged in one such battle with the people of Chicago. That great midway between the crops and natural resources of the West and the markets and capital of the East was a wicker of railroad tracks. Five million engines and freight cars passed through Chicago each year, on 1,400 miles of rails. As the city&#x2019;s population leaped, so did the number of those killed and injured by trains traversing its roads and alleys at the thousands of street-level crossings. It was Darrow&#x2019;s duty to represent the railroad in court, fighting to limit the compensation sought by the victims or their families.<br><br>The carnage was ghastly. &#x201c;A stranger&#x2019;s first impression of Chicago is that of the barbarous gridironed streets,&#x201d; a British visitor wrote, &#x201c;his&nbsp;second is that of the multitude of mutilated people . . . the mangled remnant of the massacre.&#x201d; In a single month that spring, there were forty-five deaths. One story suffices, that of the mother driving home, who froze at the roar of an approaching train. A passerby pulled her from the driver&#x2019;s bench, but her two young daughters were left behind to be shattered and tossed in the shards of the carriage as their wounded horse bellowed in pain.<br><br>But the railroads were tough, and abetted by public officials who collected &#x201c;lavish bribery . . . year after year,&#x201d; the <i>Chicago Times</i>reported. When, finally, the city council voted to compel the railroads to raise their tracks, the companies went to court. &#x201c;There is no power on earth which can compel us to elevate our tracks,&#x201d; said a confident Marvin Hughitt, <br>the president of the Chicago &amp; North Western. &#x201c;The opinions of the best lawyers in the country have been obtained.&#x201d; A test case was pending at the Supreme Court, and earlier that month Goudy had traveled to Washington to speak to the chief justice and visit with his allies at the White House. He returned to Chicago cheered about his company&#x2019;s prospects.<br>Here, then, was a blueprint for Darrow&#x2019;s aspirations. He was no scion of a wealthy family like his liberal friends, the muckraker Henry Demarest Lloyd or the philanthropist Jane Addams, who used her inheritance to found the Hull House settlement for immigrants in Chicago&#x2019;s West Side ghetto. Darrow&#x2019;s parents, though educated, were moneyless. He tasted want and shame as a child, and &#x201c;I never have been able to get over the dread of being poor, and the fear of it,&#x201d; he would confide to a friend. Nor were there government programs in this laissez-faire era for a man to fall back on in hard times, illness, or old age. The only social safety net was the free lunch offered in workingmen&#x2019;s saloons, and a bit of floor space on which to sleep in municipal hallways during Chicago&#x2019;s bitter winters. Darrow had a deep interest in learning, and in literature, &#x201c;but he has been under the awful compulsion of the age, to make money,&#x201d; his friend Brand Whitlock would tell a confidant. &#x201c;Have you ever reflected that we of this time are kept so busy making a living that we never find time to live?&#x201d;<br><br>Yet Darrow chafed in corporate harness. There was something missing in the Goudy model. If Darrow&#x2019;s cunning was a defining attribute, more so was his empathy. He was &#x201c;sensitiveness and egotism all twisted as the strands of a rope... a great character of wonderful sweetness, of profound intelligence, of Godlike patience and tenderness&#x2014;shot through with queer pettiness&#x2014;about money, about criticism,&#x201d; one of his lovers, Mary Field Parton, would confide to her diary. What saved him was his &#x201c;extraordinarily&#x201d; acute compassion, she concluded, &#x201c;the edges of his emotions sensitive as the antennae of insects.&#x201d;<br><br>Darrow felt guilty working for a corporation, where his legal skills and his boss&#x2019;s clout were employed at union busting, or to limit the relief sought by the pitiful victims of the railway crossings. He longed for peace of mind. &#x201c;It seems to me, and <i>for me</i>, that I have no right to save myself when the injustice is so great,&#x201d; he would tell Addams.<br><br>Around him was injustice in abundance. The slaughter at Chicago&#x2019;s railway crossings was emblematic of conditions in the Gilded Age, when the United States grappled with economic and social transformations that many Americans feared, with some justification, might trigger revolution. Immigrants packed the tenements of the cities, where women&nbsp; took piecework in squalid, ill-lit flats, while men and children labored in the factories, mills, mines, and collieries for twelve hours a day, six or seven days a week, for cents. Unions were assailed; a political and corporate aristocracy employed the police, the state militia, and private armies of detectives to disperse&#x2014;or gun down&#x2014;striking workers. Blacks were condemned to lynch law. Congress, the judiciary, and the state legislatures were corrupted, and the criminal justice system was no such thing. &#x201c;The rich and powerful are seldom indicted and never tried,&#x201d; one of the city&#x2019;s leading lawyers, W. S. Forrest, told an audience in 1892. &#x201c;Manslaughter is committed by corporations with impunity. Men are convicted who are innocent. Even in ordinary trials, the forms of law are frequently set aside and the rules of evidence ignored.&#x201d;<br><br>Chicago witnessed all the era&#x2019;s ills. Drenched in blood, bone-weary workers slaughtered the illimitable herds of hogs and cattle that clanked by them on the assembly lines of the stockyards. At McCormick Reaper and other storied industrial works, union organizers fighting for higher wages or an eight-hour day were locked out, harassed, and beaten by police. The houses of prostitution never closed in Little Cheyenne and the Levee, nor the predatory gambling and drinking dens. The city was divided along class lines and still seething that spring from the 1886 bombing that killed seven policemen at a workers&#x2019; rally in the Haymarket, and the subsequent public delirium that sent four guiltless anarchists to the gallows. The city&#x2019;s smokestacks cast a famous pall, to rival that of London, across the prairie sky, and the polluted water spurred outbreaks of cholera. A visitor from England, well versed in the miseries of the industrial age, was stunned. &#x201c;Chicago is a pocket edition of hell,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;and if it is not, then hell is a pocket edition of Chicago.&#x201d;<br><br>Darrow had delved into politics, joining the movement to assist the Haymarket defendants and employing his talents and political connections to persuade the Illinois legislature to pass a bill regulating sweatshops and child labor. More than a year before, he had written to Lloyd, confessing his shame at working for the railroad and praising a protest that his friend had led after a police raid on a union meeting. &#x201c;You dare to say what is true,&#x201d; Darrow told him. &#x201c;Your speech...made me feel that I am a hypocrite and a slave, and added to my resolution to make my term of servitude short.&#x201d; But he could not summon the will to act. The months passed, and his time of &#x201c;servitude&#x201d; dragged on.<br>Darrow&#x2019;s conscience was still struggling with his comfort on the morning of Thursday, April 27, when, shortly after eleven a.m., Goudy finished dictating a letter, dismissed his secretary, and summoned his first visitor&#x2014;a retired Civil War hero, General John McArthur&#x2014;into his office. Darrow prepared to join them. <br><br>&#x201c;Good morning, Judge,&#x201d; McArthur said, greeting his friend Goudy. Then: &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t look very well...are you ill?&#x201d;<br><br>Goudy seemed stricken, and gasped. McArthur cried out in alarm, and Darrow rushed in, as Goudy collapsed at his desk.<br><br>Darrow and McArthur carried the lawyer to a couch. Goudy stared up at Darrow with pleading eyes, said nothing, and died.<br><br>The great man&#x2019;s heart attack was front-page news in Chicago. &#x201c;He lived only a few minutes,&#x201d; Darrow told the reporters. &#x201c;It all happened so suddenly that we can scarcely appreciate that Mr. Goudy is really dead.&#x201d; Darrow was a pallbearer at the funeral. He had lost his patron, and his paradigm.<br><br>Goudy&#x2019;s death changed Darrow&#x2019;s life. That weekend, the newspapers carried the story: C. S. Darrow was leaving his position as lawyer for the railroad to go to work for Mayor Carter Harrison. No one then perceived that this was the birth of the grandest legal career in American history. In 1893, of Darrow&#x2019;s future clients, Eugene Debs was still an obscure labor leader with dreams of forming a national railway union. Patrick Prendergast was a mumbling paperboy, lost in delusions. Bill Haywood was a frontier ruffian. Nathan Leopold, Richard Loeb, Ossian Sweet, and John Scopes were not yet born.<br><br>And yet, in little more than a year, Darrow would be battling to keep Debs and the other ringleaders of a turbulent workers&#x2019; uprising out of prison, and to save the demented Prendergast, by then an infamous assassin, from the hangman. He would be on his way to becoming an American icon, his name synonymous with a passionate, eloquent, and miraculous defense of the underdog. Journalist Lincoln Steffens would cite Darrow&#x2019;s departure from the railroad as the &#x201c;turning point&#x201d; in his friend&#x2019;s life. &#x201c;Darrow counted the cost; he seems always to have counted the cost,&#x201d; Steffens wrote, but &#x201c;he found himself off-side, and had to cross over to where he belonged.&#x201d;<br><br>And so was born, said Steffens, &#x201c;the attorney for the damned."</p><h2>The Charterhouse of Parma (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>Translated and with an Introduction by Margaret R. B. Shaw. Covers are worn through use. Pages are browned.Softback, ex-library, with usual stamps and markings, in fair all round condition.</p><p>Officer, diplomat, spy, journalist, and intermittent genius, Marie Henri Beyle employed more than 200 aliases in the course of his crowded career. His most famous moniker, however, was Stendhal, which he affixed to his greatest work, <i>The Charterhouse of Parma</i>. The author spent a mere seven weeks cranking out this marvel in 1838, setting the fictional equivalent of a land-speed record. To be honest, there are occasional signs of haste, during which he clearly bypassed <i>le mot juste</i> in favor of narrative zing. So what? Stendhal at his sloppiest is still wittier, and wiser about human behavior, than just about any writer you could name. No wonder so meticulous a stylist as Paul Val�ry was happy to forgive his sins against French grammar: "We should never be finished with Stendhal. I can think of no greater praise than that."<p> The plot of <i>The Charterhouse of Parma</i> suggests a run-of-the-mill potboiler, complete with court intrigue, military derring-do, and more romance than you can shake a saber at. But Stendhal had an amazing, pre-Freudian grasp of psychology (at least the Gallic variant). More than most of his contemporaries, he understood the incessant jostling of love, sex, fear, and ambition, not to mention our endless capacity for self-deception. No wonder his hero, Fabrizio de Dongo, seems to know everything and nothing about himself. Even under fire at the Battle of Waterloo, the young Fabrizio has a tendency to lose himself in Napoleonic reverie: </p><blockquote>Suddenly everyone galloped off. A few moments later Fabrizio saw, twenty paces ahead, a ploughed field that seemed to be strangely in motion; the furrows were filled with water, and the wet ground that formed their crests was exploding into tiny black fragments flung three or four feet into the air. Fabrizio noticed this odd effect as he passed; then his mind returned to daydreams of the Marshal's glory. He heard a sharp cry beside him: two hussars had fallen, riddled by bullets; and when he turned to look at them, they were already twenty paces behind the escort.</blockquote> The quote above, a famous one, captures something of Stendhal's headlong style. Until now, most English-speaking readers have experienced it via C.K. Scott-Moncrieff's superb 1925 translation. But now Richard Howard has modernized his predecessor's period touches, streamlined some of the fussier locutions, and generally given Stendhal his high-velocity due. The result is a timely version of a timeless masterpiece, which shouldn't need to be updated again until, oh, 2050. Crammed with life, lust, and verbal fireworks, <i>The Charterhouse of Parma</i> demonstrates the real truth of its creator's self-composed epitaph: "He lived. He wrote. He loved." <i>--James Marcus</i>Richard Howard's exuberant and definitive rendition of Stendhal's stirring tale has brought about the rediscovery of this classic by modern readers. Stendhal narrates a young aristocrat's adventures in Napoleon's army and in the court of Parma, illuminating in the process the whole cloth of European history. As Balzac wrote, "Never before have the hearts of princes, ministers, courtiers, and women been depicted like this...one sees perfection in every detail." <br>With beautiful illustrations by Robert Andrew Parker.</p><h2>Circle Of Stones: Woman&#39;s Journey To Herself</h2><p>This is the tenth anniversary edition of the classic best seller for women seeking their sacred connections.

He was known for his visual flair and timeless innovation, a man who meticulously preplanned the color and design of each film through a series of continuity sketches that made clear camera angles, lighting, and the actors&#x2019; positions for each scene, translating dramatic conventions of the stage to the new capabilities of film. <br> Here is the long-awaited book on William Cameron Menzies, Hollywood&#x2019;s first and greatest production designer, a job title David O. Selznick invented for Menzies&#x2019; extraordinary, all-encompassing, Academy Award&#x2013;winning work on <i>Gone With the Wind</i> (which he effectively co-directed). <br><br> It was Menzies&#x2014;winner of the first-ever Academy Award for Art Direction, jointly for <i>The Dove </i>(1927) and <i>Tempest</i> (1928), and who was as well a director (fourteen pictures) and a producer (twelve pictures)&#x2014;who changed the way movies were (and still are) made, in a career that spanned four decades, from the 1920s through the 1950s. His more than 120 films include <i>Rosita</i> (1923), <i>Things to Come</i> (1936), <i>Foreign Correspondent</i> (1940), <i>Kings Row </i>(1942),<i> Mr. Lucky</i> (1943), <i>The Pride of the Yankees </i>(1943), <i>For Whom the Bell Tolls</i> (1943), <i>Address Unknown</i> (1944),<i> It&#x2019;s a Wonderful Life</i> (1947), <i>Invaders from Mars</i> (1953), and <i>Around the World in 80 Days </i>(1956).<br><br> Now, James Curtis, acclaimed film historian and biographer, writes of Menzies&#x2019; life and work as the most influential designer in the history of film. His artistry encompassed the large, scenic drawings of Douglas Fairbanks&#x2019; <i>The Thief of Bagdad</i> (1924), which created a new standard for beauty on the screen and whose exotic fairy-tale sets are still regarded as pure genius. (&#x201c;I saw <i>The Thief of Bagdad</i> when it first came out,&#x201d; said Orson Welles&#x2014;he was, at the time, a nine-year-old boy. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll never forget it.&#x201d;) Curtis writes of Menzies&#x2019; design and supervision of John Barrymore&#x2019;s<i> Beloved Rogue</i> (1927), a film that remains a masterpiece of craft and synthesis, one of the most distinctive pictures to emerge from Hollywood&#x2019;s waning days of silent films, and of his extraordinary, opulent appointments for <i>Gone With the Wind</i> (1939).<br><br> It was Menzies who defined and solidified the role of art director as having overall control of the look of the motion picture, collaborating with producers like David O. Selznick and Samuel Goldwyn; with directors such as D. W. Griffith, Raoul Walsh, Alfred Hitchcock, Lewis Milestone, and Frank Capra. And with actors as varied as Ingrid Bergman, W. C. Fields, Cary Grant, Clark Gable, John Barrymore, Barbara Stanwyck, Ronald Reagan, Gary Cooper, Vivien Leigh, Carole Lombard, Mary Pickford, Gloria Swanson, and David Niven. <br><br> Interviewing colleagues, actors, directors, friends, and family, and with full access to the William Cameron Menzies family collection of original artwork, correspondence, scrapbooks, and unpublished writing, Curtis brilliantly gives us the path-finding work of the movies&#x2019; most daring and dynamic production designer: his evolution as artist, art director, production designer, and director. Here is a portrait of a man in his time that makes clear how the movies were forever transformed by his startling, visionary work.<br><br><i>(With 16 pages of color illustrations, and black-and-white photographs throughout.)</i></p><p><b>JAMES CURTIS</b> is the author of<i> Spencer Tracy: A Biography, W. C. Fields: A Biography</i> (winner of the 2004 Theatre Library Association Award, Special Jury Prize), <i>James Whale: A New World of Gods and Monsters</i>, and<i> Between Flops: A Biography of Preston Sturges</i>. Curtis is married and lives in Brea, California.In the year 1963, Alfred Hitchcock was questioned by an earnest young interviewer who said that he presumed that all of Hitchcock&#x2019;s films were &#x201c;pre-designed by an art director.&#x201d; Did he, in fact, do all the drawings himself?<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well,&#x201d; said Hitchcock, &#x201c;art director is not a correct term.<br> &nbsp;<br> You see, an art director, as we know it in the studios, is a man who designs a set. The art director seems to leave the set before it&#x2019;s dressed and a new man comes on the set called the set dresser. Now, there is another function which goes a little further beyond the art director and is almost in a differ�ent realm. That is the production designer. Now, a production designer is a man <i>usually </i>who designs angles and sometimes production ideas. Treatment of action. There used to be a man . . . is he still alive? William Cameron Menzies. No, he&#x2019;s not. Well, I had William Cameron Menzies on a picture called <i>Foreign Correspondent </i>and he would take a sequence, you see, and by a series of sketches indicate camera setups. Now this is, in a way, nothing to do with art direction. The art director is set designing. Production design is definitely taking a sequence and laying it out in sketches. <br> &nbsp;<br> With the completion of <i>Rebecca, </i>Selznick closed his studio for an extended period, ultimately liquidating Selznick International in order to draw down the sub�stantial profits generated by <i>Gone With the Wind. </i>He began selling off the properties he owned&#x2014;<i>The Keys of the Kingdom </i>and <i>Claudia, </i>among others&#x2014;and loaning his contract talent to other producers. Vivien Leigh and Ingrid Bergman were sent to M-G-M while his one director, Hitchcock, was lent to producer Walter Wanger. The deal with Wanger was concluded on October 2, 1939, establishing Hitchcock as the director of Vincent Sheean&#x2019;s memoir <i>Personal History, </i>a property that had been under development since 1935. <br> &nbsp;<br> Considering the book dated and unsuited to his particular strengths as a sto�ryteller, Hitchcock, in collaboration with his wife, Alma Reville, and his secretary, Joan Harrison, devised an entirely new plotline which carried Sheean&#x2019;s title from the book and little else. Eventually, the title, too, would be dropped, the film instead drawing its name from Sheean&#x2019;s longtime profession&#x2014;<i>Foreign Correspondent. </i>By the time Menzies came aboard in March, reportedly at Hitchcock&#x2019;s behest, a total of twenty-two writers had contributed to the script, including John Howard Lawson, Budd Schulberg, John Meehan, James Hilton, Ben Hecht, and Robert Benchley. Indeed, Selznick may have had a hand in putting the two men together, as Hitch�cock had never before tackled a picture as big or as complex. Selznick was also keen to establish a demand for his British import, whose last released picture in the United States was <i>Jamaica Inn</i>&#x2014;a dud. <br> &nbsp;<br> Menzies found that Hitchcock, himself a former art director, was in the habit of making rough pencil sketches on his copy of the script. Menzies, in turn, worked out more than a hundred oversized drawings of sets and action for the start of production, as well as models of a dozen sets. When shooting began on March 18, 1940, the film was already four months behind schedule and progress was, at times, agonizingly slow. Menzies later recalled &#x201c;a rather unpleasant association with Hitch&#x201d; that nevertheless yielded &#x201c;some pretty good results.&#x201d; Among the principal sequences was a plane crash staged in the same manner as the dirigible crash in <i>The Lottery Bride. </i>&#x201c;I hardly used any miniatures at all,&#x201d; said Menzies, &#x201c;but did the whole thing objectively, that is from a point of view always inside the cabin. I also had a very interesting sequence in a windmill where we really got some good photographic effects, and an assassination sequence in Amsterdam in the rain, which I rather bor�rowed from <i>Our Town.</i>&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The huddle of black umbrellas to represent Emily&#x2019;s funeral cortege was a memo�rable feature of Jed Harris&#x2019; original stage production, and Menzies had elaborated on it, gathering the canopies, glistening in the rainfall, in the foreground of the shot and allowing the night sky to fully occupy the upper half of the frame. There had never been a more spiritual composition for the talking screen, and now Menzies took the same basic elements, expanded their numbers exponentially to fill a public square, and clustered them to emphasize the particularly brazen murder of a Dutch diplomat, an event that sends John Jones in pursuit of the killer, an adventure simi�lar in substance and pacing to the director&#x2019;s earlier <i>39 Steps.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> The windmill scenes were shot during the first days of production and afforded a kinetic maze of hazards and hiding places, the actors confined to a claustrophobic tangle of stairways and gears, the protagonist (Joel McCrea) eluding Nazi agents while attempting to rescue the drugged and disoriented Van Meer, whose memory holds the critical clause of an allied peace treaty. Menzies estimated he made &#x201c;about 200 drawings&#x201d; for <i>Foreign Correspondent, </i>roughly a quarter of the number he typi�cally did for a feature, implying he worked primarily on the film&#x2019;s complex set pieces.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It was my observation,&#x201d; said actress Laraine Day, &#x201c;that Mr. Hitchcock and Mr. Menzies conferred on every shot that had been drawn by Mr. Menzies. Whether or not there was a storyboard for the entire production, I don&#x2019;t really know, but it would seem reasonable to believe that if every scene was drawn before it was filmed, there must have been a storyboard from which these individual scene depictions were taken for them to discuss. Their working relationship during <i>Foreign Corre�spondent </i>seemed very close.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The crash, much more elaborate in design and execution than its 1930 predeces�sor, formed the basis for the climax of the picture. And unlike the dirigible crash in <i>Lottery Bride, </i>which took place in frozen environs of the Arctic Circle, the downing of the clipper in <i>Foreign Correspondent </i>takes place over the ocean. &#x201c;The whole thing was done in a <i>single shot </i>without a cut!&#x201d; marveled Hitchcock in his marathon 1962 interview with Fran�ois Truffaut. &#x201c;I had a transparency screen made of paper, and behind that screen, a water tank. The plane dived, and as soon as the water got close to it, I pressed the button and the water burst through, tearing the screen away. The volume was so great that you never saw the screen.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> The teaming of Alfred Hitchcock and William Cameron Menzies proved an inspired melding of two vastly different artistic sensibilities, Hitchcock being inter�ested in the conveyance of visual information, Menzies in the deepening of the film&#x2019;s graphic impact. Together, they produced one of the grand thrillers of the sound era. When production closed on May 29, 1940, after sixty-five days of shoot�ing and eleven days of retakes, the negative cost of <i>Foreign Correspondent </i>stood at $1,484,167&#x2014;by far the most expensive picture Hitchcock had ever made.</p><h2>Easy To See Why</h2><p>As she walks to the dog show with her beloved mutt, a little girl meets several dogs and their look-alike owners</p><p>In this expanded, newly illustrated edition of a story previously titled Best in Show , the recently deceased Gwynne ( A Chocolate Moose for Dinner ; Pondlarker ) has parlayed his keen sense of humor (evident in his numerous acting roles) into an inventive picture book. Relying as much on Gwynne's stiff but passable ink-and-watercolor illustrations as on the bouncy rhyming text, this tale playfully looks at the age-old colloquialism about people resembling their dogs. At its center is a girl who hears about a dog show and decides to enter her pooch (whom she does not look like). Although he lacks an impressive genealogy ("He wasn't pedigreed at all; / A mutt, you'd have to say. / His only family background was / The A.S.P.C.A."), the girl is convinced he will garner top prize. En route to the show, she meets a string of people, all of whom are dead ringers for their pure-bred dogs, and all of whom proclaim that "it's easy to see why" their pet will grab the blue ribbon. And who does? Suffice it to say the judge looks exactly like the girl's mutt. A joke easily shared by parents as well as preschoolers.

Or that the American sycamore, which has the largest tree trunk in the eastern forest, can live for 500 to 600 years? Or that in the period before the American Revolution, patriots designated a sycamore tree in each colony as a "Liberty Tree" -- a meeting place for plotting against the British?</p><p>These facts are just a few of thousands you'll find inBotanica North America, an encyclopedia of the wonderfully diverse North American native plants by noted Canadian garden writer Marjorie Harris. This charming compendium is filled with more than 420 entries that provide essential information on each plant's physical attributes, natural history, common uses, and ethnobotany. There are also fascinating, often surprising anecdotes about plants you won't find anywhere else. From the Eastern forest to the desert, this beautifully written volume roves across the continent exploring how climate and plant life have affected, aided, and inspired us, from the first Native Americans to North Americans living in the twenty-first century: "The lonely majesty of a wind-swept jack pine has inspired generations of poets and painters," Harris writes. "These trees endure in spite of terrible weather . . . a jack pine forest has a dense, closed canopy with an understory of cherry, blueberry, hazels, bracken, and sweet fern along with trailing arbutus." </p><p>Comprehensive and engaging, Botanica North America is also filled with lush photographs of plants in their natural habitat and insightful quotes from a variety of gardening experts and amateurs, from naturalist Rachel Carson to famed conservationist John Muir. </p><p>Here is a reference no gardener or environmentalist should be without.</p></p><p><p>Marjorie Harris the former chairman of the Fine Arts Department at the University of San Diego and a professional cellist. She lives in La Mesa, California.</p>Harris is currently editor of Gardening Life. <i>Botanica North America</i>, which took five years to write, is certainly her major work. <p>In separate chapters North America is divided into 10 plant communities: "The Eastern Forests," "Swamps and Wetlands," "Florida," "The Boreal Forest," "The Prairie," "The Desert," "California," "Montane," "The Tall Trees," and "The Tundra." A map illustrates the areas crossing state and provincial boundaries. The Florida plant community is the southern half of the state, and "Tall Trees" includes part of northern California. Prairie runs from Texas to the southern part of Alberta. </p><p>Throughout the text Harris stresses plant ecology and the importance of preserving the natural world. The 420 plants included are native--documented to have been in North America before exploration by Europeans (1450) and still in existence. Plants that are considered the most important historically, ecologically, or economically are first in each chapter, followed by other plants arranged in botanical families. Each entry includes botanical, ethnobotanical, geographical, and historical information. We learn that sphagnum moss was used by Native Americans to line diapers, and in World War I it was encased in muslin and used for surgical dressings. Dogwood berries are high in fat, and robins depend on them for energy in migrating from the south. Quotations, poems, and excerpts from books and articles are scattered through the text and well documented. The photographs are all in full color, and many are full-page or double-page spreads. Unfortunately, the index includes only plant names. </p><p>The two-volume <i>Botanical Garden</i> (Firefly, 2002) might be considered similar, but it is more of an identification source. <i>Botanica North America</i> concentrates less on identification and more on how North American trees, shrubs, perennials, and annuals have survived and flourished. It is a necessary acquisition for public and academic libraries with a strong botanical collection. Gardeners will love to have their own copies to read in the dead of winter or on a warm summer evening. <i>RBB</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

These once-youthful radicals, now entrenched in positions of power and influence, peddle a warmed-over version of the Marxist creed that supported the communist empire and excuses intolerance to the point of murder. Betraying the legacy of Martin Luther King, this unholy alliance of black civil rights leaders and white radicals threatens to undermine America's moral, political, and economic institutions. <p>Mr. Horowitz acknowledges that America's unique political culture is the creation of white European males, primarily English and Christian. But these very men and their heirs have led the world in abolishing slavery and establishing the principles of ethnic and racial inclusion. Undeterred, so it seems, by America's Anglo-Saxon roots, people of every race and creed still flock by the millions to these shores, claiming a share of our unparalleled rights and opportunities. Yet, with staggering hypocrisy, a clique of racial warlords and academic malcontents indict our every institution for racial oppression. </p><p>No stranger to ideological combat, Mr. Horowitz anticipates the standard charges of racism and sexism inevitably hurled at dissenters from the party line. Undaunted, he boldly grapples with contemporary racism in all its forms.</p></p><p>In his introduction to <i>Hating Whitey and Other Progressive Causes</i>, former Marxist turned conservative muckraker David Horowitz insists that his views on race "have remained entirely consistent with my previous commitments and beliefs.... I believed that only government neutrality towards racial groups was compatible with the survival of a multi-ethnic society that is also democratic. I still believe that today." Horowitz has, in fact, remained remarkably consistent in attacking elite social institutions and their subtle attempts to promote what Nicholas Lemann refers to in <i>The Big Test</i> as a "meritocracy." While former colleagues from the '60s have come to defend the rise of progressives within the bunkers of power, Horowitz still assaults the ramparts with venomous glee; his appearances on cable TV news shows, NPR, and the <i>Salon</i> Web site have earned him a legion of fans. <p> In <i>Hating Whitey</i>, Horowitz pummels administrators, hapless scholars, rival pundits, and embattled defenders of affirmative action and race-based quotas. But while Stephan and Abigail Thernstrom and Shelby Steele have made the case against racial preference with rigorous methodological approaches or rhetorical eloquence, Horowitz doesn't throw much new light on the issue. Even the revealing personal essays dealing with the author's ill-fated tenure with the Black Panthers in the early '70s recycle material previously covered in his autobiography <i>Radical Son</i>. This time around, Horowitz mostly names names and issues ideological fatwas against those with whom he disagrees, invoking the 1950s anti-Communist newsletter <i>Red Channels</i> at its prime. <i>Hating Whitey</i> may satiate the blood lust of the converted, but it's only marginally useful in the larger discussions of race relations in America. <i>--John M. Anderson</i></p>David Horowitz is the author of the best-selling autobiography Radical Son and co-author of Destructive Generation. A former leftist, he has nevertheless maintained consistent views on race throughout his polemical career. He is president of the Center for the Study of Popular Culture and editor of the journal Heterodoxy.

Refuting Dawkins on Evolution</h2><p>Richard Dawkins is the world&#39;s best-known champion of both atheism and its intellectual underpinning, particles-to-people evolution. His latest book, The Greatest Show on Earth: the evidence for evolution is touted as an unanswerable challenge to those who believe in divine creation. In the past, he says, he has assumed evolution; this time he lays out in one major book the evidence for evolution (and its corollary, vast geological ages). Now scientist, chess master and logician Jonathan Sarfati Ph.D. FM goes head to head with Dawkins in this full-on rebuttal, The Greatest Hoax on Earth? Refuting Dawkins on Evolution. Sarfati is no lightweight opponent; his Refuting Evolution at over 500,000 in print is the biggest-selling creationist book ever. In his crisp, highly readable trademark style, Sarfati&#39;s sheer competence relentlessly erodes each of Dawkins&#39; claims and in the process, exposes the logical fallacies and even some of the dubious tactics employed. It&#39;s precisely those who feel smug in the belief that all the intellectual firepower is on the side of evolution who most need to read Sarfati&#39;s book if only to understand better why it is that there are thousands of scientists and intellectuals today who are convinced that biblical creation outguns evolution in a fair science showdown, stripped bare of rhetoric and ideological &#39;noise&#39;.</p><p>Jonathan received his B.Sc. (hons) in Chemistry and his Ph.D. (Physical Chemistry) from Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. He has co-authored papers in mainstream scientific journals including one on high-temperature superconductors published in Nature when he was 22 years old. He has long been interested in apologetics, and was a co-founder of the Wellington Christian Apologetics Society (New Zealand). His first book Refuting Evolution was written to counter a teachers guidebook by the National Academy of Sciences (USA), Teaching about Evolution and the Nature of Science. It now has over 400,000 copies in print. He later wrote Refuting Evolution 2 and the highly acclaimed Refuting Compromise, both as responses to attacks on the biblical view of history, plus the booklet Mammoth: Riddle of the Ice Age. Jonathan is co-author of the updated Answers Book, 15 Reasons to Take Genesis as History and the booklet Why is there Death and Suffering? He works full-time for Creation Ministries International in Brisbane, Australia where he is a co-editor of Creation magazine and also writes and reviews articles for the in-depth, peer-reviewed Journal of Creation (formerly TJ), as well as being active in speaking ministry. Jonathan is also an accomplished chess player and is a former New Zealand Chess Champion, representing New Zealand in three Chess Olympiads (and drew with Boris Spassky, world champion 1969-1972). In 1988, the International Chess Federation awarded him the title of F.I.D.E. Master (FM). For the fun of it, he regularly accepts challenges from multiple players while he is blindfolded. He then plays from memory with up to 12 players simultaneously.I lost my Evolution Faith when being taught by London University's Professor J.Z. Young, FRS, arguably the greatest Darwinian evolutionist of the 20th Century. I have since been waiting for a 21st Century genius to prove that the Darwinian Evolution Emperor has no clothes. Jonathan Sarfati is that genius as you can see from this his latest masterpiece. With an astonishing array of scientific references, Sarfati has demonstrated that he is far and away the better debater than Richard Dawkins. Read it, and re-read it! --Dr. Felix Konotey-Ahulu (a world authority on sickle cell anemia), Kwegyir Aggrey Distinguished Professor of Human Genetics, University of Cape Coast, Ghana, and Former Consultant Physician Genetic Counsellor, Cromwell Hospital, London<br><br>Any rational debate requires the honest presentation of both sides. But there exists a powerful, self-styled 'intellectual elite' [that] would have a debate wherein only one side was heard while the other side was either ignored or grossly misrepresented. ... In my opinion Sarfati's book beats Dawkins' book, point by point, on all issues. --John Sanford Ph.D., Courtesy Associate Professor, Dept. of Horticultural Sciences, Cornell University. (John is a pioneer of genetic engineering and inventor of the gene gun)<br><br>An excellent rebuttal to the best evolution has to offer. The reader should walk away with the understanding that evolutionary theory is a house of cards and its chief spokesmen are promoting poor, illogical, and false arguments against the only viable alternative: biblical creation. --Robert Carter, Ph.D. in Marine Biology and Genetics (University of Miami)</p><h2>The Odds Must Be Crazy: Beating the Races With the Man Who Revolutionized Handicapping</h2><p>A horseracing expert explains the system that has made him a legendary figure, detailing the nuts and bolts of handicapping and successful betting, along with his own life story</p><p>Len Ragozin is president of Ragozin Thoroughbred Data.Ragozin and his famed "sheets," which chart the race-by-race development of thoroughbreds, are legendary in horse-racing circles, so anyone who is at all serious about handicapping will want to read his book. Most will be disappointed. Ragozin explains how to use the sheets once they are purchased from him, but he won't explain how handicappers can compile their own numbers and make their own sheets using his methodology. It's Ragozin's prerogative to keep his trade secrets, of course, but why write a book if you aren't going to tell what you know? Here the answer seems all too obvious. The book is an advertisement for the sheets, apparently written to attract more customers. Still, Ragozin does provide some insights into what he calls "condition handicapping," which involves using patterns created by race-by-race speed figures to project future performances. Ragozin's reputation with horseplayers ensures significant demand for his book in cities with thoroughbred racetracks.

Are wilderness fires now a tragic and enduring feature of the American landscape? John N.

Ethnic cleansing forces many families to seek safety in the surrounding hills and mountains. The Kosovo Liberation Army fights back guerrilla style, struggling for an independent Kosovo. Some Albanian villagers support the freedom fighters. Others fear that armed resistance, which they have successfully avoided through long years of Serb repression, will only increase the death toll. And always there is terrible tension between Serbian and Albanian neighbors who once were friends. Eleven-year-old Zana Dugolli, an Albanian Kosovar, isn't sure what to think. She does know not to speak her language to Serbs. And every day she worries about her mother and father, her brothers, the farm, the apple orchard. Already she has lost her best friend, a Serb. Then Zana's village is shelled, and her worst nightmare is realized. Her father and two brothers are killed in the attack, and her leg is shattered by shrapnel. Alone in a Serb hospital, she remembers her father's words: "Don't let them fill your heart with hate." <br><br>Based on a true story, Alice Mead's stark, affecting novel about a place and conflict she knows well will help young readers understand the war in Kosovo.<br></p><p>"How was it that foreigners could come take pictures of us when we were dead, but couldn't come to help us stay alive?" Eleven-year-old Zana Dugolli doesn't understand how the rest of the world can send reporters to record the violence that is inflicted daily on Kosovo-born Albanians by the brutal Serbian military, yet do nothing to stop it. In the late 1990s, Zana's rural village is targeted when the Serbian ruling class steps up its efforts to completely wipe out ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Unbelievingly, she watches as a bomb explodes right in front of her, killing her father and two brothers. Zana's own leg is shattered by the blast, and the physical pain added to the grief of losing half her family is almost more than she can bear. Sick with fear, Zana wonders how much longer she, her mother, and her remaining brother can face the demoralizing effects of so much hate. "All I knew was that I was slowly losing my life. I felt betrayed by everyone and everything. I couldn't trust the ground itself. If a bomb fell on it, it could swallow me whole." <p> Alice Mead, author of the much-lauded <i>Adem's Cross</i>, continues to draw attention to the horrific Serbian-Albanian conflict with <i>Girl of Kosovo</i>. Brutal and moving, this novel is sure to stir the activist that lives in the heart of every teen and propel young readers to a greater understanding of race, war, and politics. (Ages 10 and older) <i>--Jennifer Hubert</i></p>old Zana enjoys her village life in Kosovo, even though she never feels entirely safe. Her family of Kosovo-born Albanians are ruled by the Serbian police and army. They want to destroy anyone fighting for an independent Kosovo. When bombs explode around Zana&#x2019;s village, her life fills with terror and tragedy. Still she remembers her father&#x2019;s words: &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let them fill your heart with hate.&#x201d; But that&#x2019;s hard when those that were her friends are now her enemies.</p><h2>Western Landscaping Book: Companion to the Best-Selling Western Garden Book</h2><p><p>This all-new second edition, the companion book to the much-beloved <em>Western Garden Book</em>, promises to be just as successful as the first.

Locating his final resting place&#x2013;unknown to this day&#x2013;remains a tantalizing goal for both archaeologists and treasure hunters. Now the quest for this coveted prize is about to heat up.

Sharp, acrid, with a hint of sulfur. And something else. Sweet and sickening. <br><br>Like death. <br><br>He opened his eyes. <br><br>He lay prone on the floor, arms extended, palms to the hardwood, which he immediately noticed was sticky. <br><br>What happened? <br><br>He&#x2019;d attended the April gathering of the Danish Antiquarian Booksellers Society a few blocks west of his bookshop, near the gaiety of Tivoli. He liked the monthly meetings and this one had been no exception. A few drinks, some friends, and lots of book chatter. Tomorrow morning he&#x2019;d agreed to meet Cassiopeia Vitt. Her call yesterday to arrange the meeting had surprised him. He&#x2019;d not heard from her since Christmas, when she&#x2019;d spent a few days in Copenhagen. He&#x2019;d been cruising back home on his bicycle, enjoying the comfortable spring night, when he&#x2019;d decided to check out the unusual meeting location she&#x2019;d chosen, the Museum of Greco-Roman Culture&#x2013;a preparatory habit from his former profession. Cassiopeia rarely did anything on impulse, so a little advance preparation wasn&#x2019;t a bad idea. <br><br>He&#x2019;d found the address, which faced the Frederiksholms canal, and noticed a half-open door to the pitch-dark building&#x2013;a door that should normally be closed and alarmed. He&#x2019;d parked his bike. The least he could do was close the door and phone the police when he returned home. <br><br>But the last thing he remembered was grasping the doorknob. <br><br>He was now inside the museum. <br><br>In the ambient light that filtered in through two plate-glass windows, he saw a space decorated in typical Danish style&#x2013;a sleek mixture of steel, wood, glass, and aluminum. The right side of his head throbbed and he caressed a tender knot. <br><br>He shook the fog from his brain and stood. <br><br>He&#x2019;d visited this museum once and had been unimpressed with its collection of Greek and Roman artifacts. Just one of a hundred or more private collections throughout Copenhagen, their subject matter as varied as the city&#x2019;s population. <br><br>He steadied himself against a glass display case. His fingertips again came away sticky and smelly, with the same nauseating odor. <br><br>He noticed that his shirt and trousers were damp, as was his hair, face, and arms. Whatever covered the museum&#x2019;s interior coated him, too. <br><br>He stumbled toward the front entrance and tried the door. Locked. Double dead bolt. A key would be needed to open it from the inside. <br><br>He stared back into the interior. The ceiling soared thirty feet. A wood-and-chrome staircase led up to a second floor that dissolved into more darkness, the ground floor extending out beneath. <br><br>He found a light switch. Nothing. He lumbered over to a desk phone. No dial tone. <br><br>A noise disturbed the silence. Clicks and whines, like gears working. Coming from the second floor. <br>His training as a Justice Department agent cautioned him to keep quiet, but also urged him to investigate. <br><br>So he silently climbed the stairs. <br><br>The chrome banister was damp, as were each of the laminated risers. Fifteen steps up, more glass-and-chrome display cases dotted the hardwood floor. Marble reliefs and partial bronzes on pedestals loomed like ghosts. Movement caught his eye twenty feet away. An object rolling across the floor. Maybe two feet wide with rounded sides, pale in color, tight to the ground, like one of those robotic lawn mowers he&#x2019;d once seen advertised. When a display case or statue was encountered, the thing stopped, retreated, then darted in a different direction. A nozzle extended from its top and every few seconds a burst of aerosol spewed out. <br><br>He stepped close. <br><br>All movement stopped. As if it sensed his presence. The nozzle swung to face him. A cloud of mist soaked his pants. <br><br>What was this? <br><br>The machine seemed to lose interest and scooted deeper into the darkness, more odorous mist expelling along the way. He stared down over the railing to the ground floor and spotted another of the contraptions parked beside a display case. <br><br>Nothing about this seemed good. <br><br>He needed to leave. The stench was beginning to turn his stomach. <br><br>The machine ceased its roaming and he heard a new sound. <br><br>Two years ago, before his divorce, his retirement from the government, and his abrupt move to Copenhagen, when he&#x2019;d lived in Atlanta, he&#x2019;d spent a few hundred dollars on a stainless-steel grill. The unit came with a red button that, when pumped, sparked a gas flame. He recalled the sound the igniter made with each pump of the button. <br><br>The same clicking he heard right now. <br><br>Sparks flashed. <br><br>The floor burst to life, first sun yellow, then burnt orange, finally settling on pale blue as flames radiated outward, consuming the hardwood. Flames simultaneously roared up the walls. The temperature rose swiftly and he raised an arm to shield his face. The ceiling joined the conflagration, and in less than fifteen seconds the second floor was totally ablaze. <br><br>Overhead sprinklers sprang to life. <br><br>He partially retreated down the staircase and waited for the fire to be doused. <br><br>But he noticed something. <br><br>The water simply aggravated the flames. <br><br>The machine that started the disaster suddenly disintegrated in a muted flash, flames rolling out in all directions, like waves searching for shore. <br><br>A fireball drifted to the ceiling and seemed to be welcomed by the spraying water. Steam thickened the air, not with smoke but with a chemical that made his head spin. <br><br>He leaped down the stairs two at a time. Another swoosh racked the second floor. Followed by two more. Glass shattered. Something crashed. <br><br>He darted to the front of the building. <br><br>The other gizmo that had sat dormant sprang to life and started skirting the ground-floor display cases. <br>More aerosol spewed into the scorching air. <br><br>He needed to get out. But the locked front door opened to the inside. Metal frame, thick wood. No way to kick it open. He watched as fire eased down the staircase, consuming each riser, like the devil descending to greet him. Even the chrome was being devoured with a vengeance.<br> <br>His breaths became labored, thanks to the chemical fog and the rapidly vanishing oxygen. Surely someone would call the fire department, but they&#x2019;d be no help to him. If a spark touched his soaked clothes . . . <br><br>The blaze found the bottom of the staircase. <br><br>Ten feet away.</p><h2>DreadfulWater (DreadfulWater, 1)</h2><p><p><strong>The award-winning, bestselling author of <em>The Back of the Turtle </em>and <em>The Inconvenient Indian</em> masters the comic mystery novel in this series opener, starring ex-cop Thumps DreadfulWater</strong></p><p>Thumps DreadfulWater is a Cherokee ex-cop trying to make a living as a photographer in the small town of Chinook, somewhere in the northwestern United States.

"That's what you're selling." </p><p> It was baloney, of course, the kind that Sterling liked to slice and serve when he was trying to be motivational. To be sure, the views at Buffalo Mountain Resort were spectacular -- the mountains almost in your living room, the heavy forest of pine and spruce, the river racing down White Goat Canyon and leaping over the edge of the Bozeman Fault, and the vast expanse of prairies stretching out forever under the towering sky. </p><p> But the views aside, Ora Mae knew what Buffalo Mountain Resort was really selling -- the illusion that you had escaped the rush of the city for the sanctuary of the wilderness, the knowledge that you were among the elite in the vacation retreat game, and the security of the guard at the front gate. </p><p> There was wilderness out there, all right. Places to get lost. Cliffs to fall off. Bears. Moose. Maybe even a pack of wolves to brighten your day. But the condominium and casino complex was about as wild as Banff or Lake Tahoe or wherever the rich gathered for an outdoor adventure. </p><p> Ora Mae wasn't sure that the Indians had done the right thing, building the complex. Claire Merchant had made Buffalo Mountain the main issue in the tribal election, and Claire had come away with enough votes to carry the day. But not without splitting the council, dividing families, and destroying old alliances. Ironically, the most visible casualty was Claire herself, for her son, Stanley -- or Stick, as he was known to everyone except his mother -- disagreed with her vision of economic independence, formed a mildly militant organization called the Red Hawk Society, and began picketing the project. The protests had interrupted construction from time to time, but aside from the one day someone had bounced a bullet off an idle dump truck and sent everyone scrambling for cover, there hadn't been any real violence. Just hurt feelings and sore voices. And the bitter taste of having to choose sides. </p><p> But that was Indian business and none of Ora Mae's concern. When the complex opened in another week, her job was to move the units as fast as she could. </p><p> "Get a feel for the place," Sterling told everyone. "Walk through the models. Stand on the balconies. Imagine what it would be like to own a place like this." </p><p> Not that anyone in the office could afford one of the units. Even the cheap one-bedrooms on the north side, where the view included the top of the casino and the parking lot, were going for over a quarter of a million dollars. </p><p> Ora Mae was in the middle of the obituaries and working on the last of the doughnut holes when her cell phone went off. When Sterling first passed the phones out to all the agents, Ora Mae thought having a cell phone was the cream on the shortcake. For the first couple of weeks, every time it rang, she couldn't get it out of her purse fast enough. But it didn't take her long to realize that while the phone was cute, even useful, it was also a tether. The longer she dragged it around, the more it reminded her of her sister in Salt Lake City and her four kids. They were cute, too. </p><p> Now she hated the damn thing, and every time it rang, she would wait a little longer before she answered it. Most of the time, Sterling was on the other end, and Ora Mae didn't mind making him wait until the pond froze and the geese went south. </p><p> "Where are you?" </p><p> The man had all the social graces of shag carpet. Ora Mae licked her fingers slowly. They still tasted of warm chocolate. </p><p> "At the complex." </p><p> "Is everything okay?" </p><p> Ever since the models had been furnished and loaded up with all the goodies that rich people required, Sterling had worried about the place being vandalized. So, for the past two weeks, someone from the office had had to drive from Chinook to the complex each day, just to settle Sterling's mind that all of the models still had their potpourri and none of the expensive toys had gone missing. </p><p> "Have you seen Clarence?" </p><p> "Nope." </p><p> Clarence Fellows was Sterling's nephew, a young, muscular man just out of community college who thought of himself as a sports car. Especially when it came to women. When it came to work, however, Clarence was more an old bus with four flat tires and a dead battery. </p><p> "He was supposed to check the models yesterday." </p><p> "That right?" </p><p> "But I didn't hear from him." </p><p> "You try his cell phone?" </p><p> "Responsibility," said Sterling, his voice wading through warm custard. "The first imperative of a good agent is responsibility." </p><p> Ora Mae generally tried to steer clear of other people's business. "Don't worry, Sterling, everything's fine." </p><p> "No trouble?" </p><p> "Trouble" was Sterling's noun for anything gone wrong. An unhappy client was trouble. A bounced check was trouble. Floods, forest fires, terminal diseases, high interest rates, loose fan belts, tooth decay. Bad haircuts. Sterling liked things that were predictable and organized. Just what he was doing in the real estate business was a mystery. </p><p> "Not a drop." </p><p> "Because we don't want trouble, do we?" </p><p> It was a rhetorical question, and Ora Mae had given up answering that kind of question even before she left home and headed West to see the sights and make her fortune. That was twenty years ago, and all in all, the sights had been worth it. </p><p> "Don't forget to check all the units." </p><p> "Maybe Clarence is putting a big deal together." Ora Mae could hear the smile in her voice and wondered whether Sterling could hear it, too. Probably not, she thought. The only voice Sterling ever listened to was his own. </p><p> "And call me back." </p><p> Buffalo Mountain Resort had been designed by Douglas Cardinal and had already won several awards for the innovative way Cardinal had combined the demands of an upscale resort with traditional Native motifs and concerns. The most prominent building, the one you saw first as you came off the prairie floor and headed into the foothills, was the casino, a huge copper-plated geodesic dome that glowed and shimmered in the light. </p><p> The condominium complex itself was to the south and west of the casino. It was taller than the casino, but the gray concrete walls and the tinted windows made the building all but disappear into the face of the mountains. </p><p> Sterling had had an aerial photograph taken of the area and had tacked it to the wall behind his desk. You couldn't see the pattern from the ground, but looking at the buildings from above, it was clear that Cardinal had been both creative and literal. What the cluster of buildings most resembled, if you used your imagination a little, was a buffalo warming itself in the high plains sun. </p><p> Ora Mae reluctantly stood up and brushed the crumbs off the patio table. She folded the doughnut bag neatly, slipped it into her purse along with the thermos, and checked her shoes to make sure she wasn't tracking anything across the pale wool rug. </p><p> For just a moment, she thought about calling Sterling and telling him that a toilet had backed up and overflowed onto the carpet, </p><p> or that a large bird had flown into one of the windows and shattered the glass, or that a small electrical fire had damaged a kitchen. She took a moment's pleasure in imagining Sterling's face, but she didn't even think about opening her purse. That was one thing she and Sterling Noseworthy the Fourth or Fifth, whichever he was, had in common. She didn't like trouble any better than he did. </p><p> Trouble, Ora Mae's mother had told her and her sisters, was like a man, never in short supply, never too far away. </p><p> The Cataract was the smallest of the models, a long, narrow one-bedroom with a kitchen at one end and a living room at the other. Ora Mae had spent some time trying to find a good adjective for it, something she could use as a selling point. The closest she had come was "cozy." "Cozy" was almost the right size, but "cozy" also suggested good light and a warm, homey feel. </p><p> "Place is so small," she had heard Clarence tell Sterling, "a man can stand at the front door and piss in the toilet with his eyes closed." </p><p> It was male grunting. Ora Mae had heard it all before, and she was sure that the attempt wouldn't be worth the watching. If the bathroom at the office was any indicator, Clarence standing across the room from the toilet with his eyes shut wasn't going to be any better or worse than Clarence standing next to the toilet with his eyes open. </p><p> When Ora Mae opened the door to the Cataract, she had the distinct feeling that she was not alone. "Clarence?" </p><p> She knew about Clarence and Celia Brothers. It was supposed to be a secret, but probably the only two people who didn't know that Clarence and Celia had been touring the motels in the immediate area were Clarence's wife, Barbara, and Sterling. Ora Mae suspected that Barbara did know, in fact, and was just waiting for the right moment to cut Clarence's heart out. </p><p> "Clarence! You here?" </p><p> Ora Mae stood in the doorway and tested the air. It was heavy and stale. But above the formaldehyde off-gassing from the carpet and particleboard furniture, and the sharp stink of new paint, was an unfamiliar smell, acrid and sweet. An unpleasant smell. A smell that made her anxious and grumpy. </p><p> Word was Clarence had run out of motels in the area and had been bringing Celia out to the resort. But the one-bedroom unit? God! The man had no more romance than a Kleenex. </p><p> "Give it up, Clarence." </p><p> The bedroom was empty, and the bed had not been slept in. Thank God she didn't have to deal with Clarence and Celia naked and hiding in the closet. Ora Mae walked to the living room and looked out the window. Below, the top of the casino was bright gold and red, and all around it, the asphalt parking lot spread out like a lava flow, eating its way through the rocks and the trees and the thick prairie grass. She stood in the light and tried to imagine what she was going to say to prospective buyers to get them to pony up a quarter of a million dollars for a hallway with a designer toilet. Probably something about investment. </p><p> It wasn't until she turned around and started for the door that she saw the man. </p><p> He was slumped in a large wing-back chair facing the window. He looked comfortable enough, and if it hadn't been for the way his eyes stared at nothing in particular, Ora Mae might have thought he was relaxing and enjoying the peace and quiet that came with owning a piece of Buffalo Mountain Resort. </p><p> As she stood looking at the man, she realized she hadn't taken a breath in the last little while. When she did, it was a long, deep breath, and as she pulled it in, she willed her shoulders to drop and her hands to relax. She had seen bodies before, and it had been a long time since she had let a man, alive or dead, scare her. </p><p><br> Ora Mae walked back to the Cascade.

Visionary art, art brut, art of the insane, na*ve art, vernacular art, "raw vision"&#x2014;what do all these and many other categories describe? An art made outside the boundaries of official culture, first recognized more than a century ago by German psychiatrists who appreciated the profound artistic expression in the work of institutionalized patients. Promoted by brilliant museum curators like Alfred Barr and artists like Jean Dubuffet, such work became a wellspring of modern and contemporary art. This volume brings<br>together works by twelve of the most influential self-taught artists to emerge during the past century. Each represents a facet of the outsider art phenomenon, from mental patients like Adolf W�lfli and Mart'n Ram'rez, through vernacular masters like Bill Traylor and Thornton Dial, to artists who seem to be in touch with other worlds, such as Madge Gill and Henry Darger. Related artists are featured along with each key figure, allowing a fuller picture to emerge. This book presents a narrative of the history of<br>outsider art, clarifies predominant theoretical issues, and draws comparisons with the modernist tradition. It brings into focus the enormous contributions self-taught artists have made to our<br>understanding of creative genius and presents them in a book that will enthrall anyone interested in Outsider Art.</p><p>More than 100 years of unschooled artistic genius is gathered in this wide-ranging survey that will elight and inform Outsider Art&#x2019;s rapidly growing audience.CHARLES RUSSELL is Professor Emeritus of English and American Studies at Rutgers University, Newark.

Here, Newman covers the 120-odd years through mid- 1991, during which HBC devolved into the Dominion's largest department-store chain. As before, the author again focuses on larger-than-life personalities who played major roles in the corporate drama. Among them are the rascally, self-serving Donald Alexander Smith, a longtime governor of HBC, as well as Kenneth (Lord) Thomson, the miserly heir to a newspaper/petroleum fortune who gained control of ``The Bay'' (as it's known up north) in 1979. Between the polar- opposite regimes of these two, Newman tracks HBC's expansion into the Arctic, the subsequent decline of the mainstay fur trade, and the boardroom battles that resulted in the shift of HBC's legal domicile from London to Winnipeg on the 300th anniversary of its founding. Along the way, he offers a wealth of anecdotal detail on The Bay's abortive involvements in filmmaking (37 features), wartime shipping (110 vessels sunk by German subs), bootlegging, and allied ventures that yielded few returns for investors. But despite its proving less than a financial success for backers over the years, HBC, Newman insists, has contributed immeasurably to the making of Canada's character--for instance, in the way the company's hinterland outposts established enduring commercial ties with the aboriginal inhabitants, stressing collective survival. By contrast, the author argues, fiercely independent individuals with little sense of community conquered America's frontier with shot and shell, slaughtering Indians for their furs or just to ``watch 'em spin.'' Newman concludes that the HBC has suffered irretrievable loss from the Faustian survival bargain that obliged it to exchange a many-splendored heritage for a mess of merchandising pottage. Absorbing and praiseworthy. The elegantly written text is profusely illustrated. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In the third and concluding volume of his history of the Hudson's Bay Company, Canadian journalist Newman ( Empire of the Bay ) traces the growth of the 300-year-old firm from its Arctic colonizing efforts to its 1980s status as a mercantile, transportation and urban real estate empire extending over one-twelfth of the globe. A splendid storyteller and indefatigable researcher, the author never allows the sweep of world and national events or the boardroom politics and internal struggles between London and Winnipeg to obscure the importance of individual adventurers and developers. Notable among the memorable portraits here is that of legendary Donald "Labrador" Smith (1820-1914), who not only served HBC for 75 years but was prominent in Canadian politics, economic and rail expansion and is credited with transforming his country from colony to nation. Smith would have rejoiced at HBC's Canadianization of the company completed in 1979 with its acquisition for $641 million (cash) by a radically different leader, Canadian billionaire Ken Thomson.

H. Auden, poet and critic, will conduct a course on Shakespeare at the New School for Social Research beginning Wednesday. Mr. Auden has announced that in his course . . . he proposes to read all Shakespeare's plays in chronological order." <i>The New York Times</i> reported this item on September 27, 1946, giving notice of a rare opportunity to hear one of the century's great poets comment on one of the greatest poets of all time. Published here for the first time, these lectures now make Auden's thoughts on Shakespeare available widely.</p><br><p> Painstakingly reconstructed by Arthur Kirsch from the notes of students who attended, primarily Alan Ansen, who became Auden's secretary and friend, the lectures afford remarkable insights into Shakespeare's plays as well as the sonnets.</p><br><p> A remarkable lecturer, Auden could inspire his listeners to great feats of recall and dictation. Consequently, the poet's unique voice, often down to the precise details of his phrasing, speaks clearly and eloquently throughout this volume. In these lectures, we hear Auden alluding to authors from Homer, Dante, and St. Augustine to Kierkegaard, Ibsen, and T. S. Eliot, drawing upon the full range of European literature and opera, and referring to the day's newspapers and magazines, movies and cartoons. The result is an extended instance of the "live conversation" that Auden believed criticism to be. Notably a conversation between Auden's capacious thought and the work of Shakespeare, these lectures are also a prelude to many ideas developed in Auden's later prose--a prose in which, one critic has remarked, "all the artists of the past are alive and talking among themselves."</p><br><p> Reflecting the twentieth-century poet's lifelong engagement with the crowning masterpieces of English literature, these lectures add immeasurably to both our understanding of Auden and our appreciation of Shakespeare.</p></p><p>After transplanting himself from England to the United States in 1939, W.H. Auden immediately became a kind of academic knight-errant, teaching at five different schools in as many years. Little evidence survives of most of these gigs. But in 1946, Auden gave a course on Shakespeare at Manhattan's New School, and luckily, several of the students attending took maniacally assiduous notes. Now Arthur Kirsch has collated the whole batch--and, one assumes, done some major nip-and-tuck work on this textual nightmare. The result is an insightful, eccentric, and perhaps essential slice of Bardolatry, which tells us as much about Auden as his subject.<p> Nobody can accuse Auden of parroting the party line on this greatest of English writers. In one of the nuttier moments in the lecture series, in fact, he expressed his distaste for <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i> by declining to say a word about it--instead he simply played a recording of Verdi's <i>Falstaff</i> for the perplexed audience. Elsewhere his tendency was to view Shakespeare's creations as flesh-and-blood characters rather than poetic constructs: "If Antony and Cleopatra have a more tragic fate than we do, that is because they are far more successful than we are, not because they are essentially different." He's harder pressed to locate any success stories in <i>Julius Ceasar</i>: the protagonist strikes him as a fading despot, Octavius is "a very cold fish," and Cassius "a choleric man--a General Patton." And sometimes, as in this discussion of Falstaff's role in the double-decker <i>Henry IV</i>, Auden spins off his own freestanding riffs, which amount to short prose poems on Shakespearean themes: </p><blockquote> A fat man looks like a cross between a very young child and a pregnant mother. The Greeks thought of Narcissus as a slender youth, but I think they were wrong. I see him as a middle-aged man with a corporation, for, however ashamed he may be of displaying it in public, in private a man with a belly loves it dearly--it may be an unprepossessing child to look at, but he's borne it all by himself. </blockquote> Auden would return to the Bard's terrain many times in his career, most notably in "The Sea and the Mirror." But for sheer penetration and puckish humor, <i>Lectures on Shakespeare</i> is hard to beat, and demonstrates that for all their differences, both the speaker and his subject had a crucial thing in common--what Auden calls "a fabulously good taste for words." <i>--James Marcus</i><p>"What Auden has to say about Shakepeare's plays is almost always interesting, for two reasons. First, he knows how to praise or dissent, and to do so with much originality; secondly, he speaks of the ideas that were shaping his own thought and work at this important moment in his career, so that this book is as much a contribution to our understanding of Auden as it is to our appreciation of Shakespeare. It is beautifully edited and should interest all readers of Shakespeare and all admirers of Auden."<b>--Frank Kermode</b></p><p>"Auden's lectures on Shakespeare are a marvelous blend of steady, patient intelligence and stunning insight--spirited, free-thinking, resourceful, unintimidated, liberated from the air of treacly piety, and very, very intelligent."<b>--Stephen Greenblatt</b></p></p><h2>Stampede of the Supermarket Slugs (A Stepping Stone Book(TM))</h2><p>Fast on the fins of <i>Attack of the Shark-Headed Zombie</i> is Bill Doyle's second tale of magic and mayhem.<br><br>Mr. Cigam has a new job for Keats and Henry.

The city's vast wealth created centuries earlier by powerful Levantine dynasties, its factories teemed with Greeks, Armenians, Turks, and Jews. Together, they had created a majority Christian city that was unique in the Islamic world. But to the Turkish nationalists, Smyrna was a city of infidels.<p>In the aftermath of the First World War and with the support of the Great Powers, Greece had invaded Turkey with the aim of restoring a Christian empire in Asia. But by the summer of 1922, the Greeks had been vanquished by Atat�rk's armies after three years of warfare. As Greek troops retreated, the non-Muslim civilians of Smyrna assumed that American and European warships would intervene if and when the Turkish cavalry decided to enter the city. But this was not to be.</p><p> On September 13, 1922, Turkish troops descended on Smyrna. They rampaged first through the Armenian quarter, and then throughout the rest of the city. They looted homes, raped women, and murdered untold thousands. Turkish soldiers were seen dousing buildings with petroleum. Soon, all but the Turkish quarter of the city was in flames and hundreds of thousands of refugees crowded the waterfront, desperate to escape. The city burned for four days; by the time the embers cooled, more than 100,000 people had been killed and millions left homeless.</p><p>Based on eyewitness accounts and the memories of survivors, many interviewed for the first time, <i>Paradise Lost</i> offers a vivid narrative account of one of the most vicious military catastrophes of the modern age.</p></p><p><b>Giles Milton</b> is a journalist and best-selling author of five previous works of nonfiction: <i>White Gold</i>, <i>Samurai William</i>, <i>The Riddle and the Knight</i>, <i>Big Chief Elizabeth</i>, and <i>Nathaniel's Nutmeg</i>. He lives in London.Smyrna was a prosperous, cosmopolitan port on Turkey's Aegean coast where Greeks, Turks, Armenians, Jews and other nationalities lived in harmony. In his searingly vivid account of Smyrna's destruction by the Turks in 1922, acclaimed popular historian Milton (<i>Nathaniel's Nutmeg</i>) begins with a fairy tale&#x2013;like description of the city focused lopsidedly on the wealthy European dynasties known as Levantines. But Milton renders an astute account of the clash of Greek and Turkish nationalisms and the unhelpful meddling of Western powers, particularly Britain, which supported a Greek incursion into Turkey. When the defending Turkish troops under Mustafa Kemal (aka Ataturk) took Smyrna in September 1922, a horrific killing spree of Greeks and Armenians began, and hundreds of thousands of refugees were trapped on the quayside between the sea and a city willfully torched by the Turks as a score of foreign vessels looked on. Milton draws on eyewitness accounts to render these events in all their horror, and ends with an almost incredible rescue led by an unlikely hero. Milton powerfully renders this tragic tale of an army that came to liberate Smyrna and instead massacred its citizens and burned their prize to the ground in a vengeful frenzy. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In 1921 readers witness Claude Monet overseeing his glorious water-lily gardens. Next to that is an image of starving children in the Russian famine that followed the end of World War I. The young Princess Elizabeth walks her corgi in London's Hyde Park in 1934, while the facing page shows the moment of King Alexander I's assassination in Marseilles. American GIs laugh with girls on a German beach in 1946--a couple of pages on from the then recently revealed horrors of the concentration camp at Auschwitz. Three decades later, sees the Sex Pistols inaugurating the era of punk rock, while anti-apartheid leader Steve Biko lies murdered by police in his South African jail cell. By turns harrowing and humorous, <i>Century</i> is a magnificent photographic testament to 100 years of human advancement, futility, acts of heroism, and episodes of unspeakable cruelty. The book ends on a note of hope with a still from a 1999 German production of Beethoven's opera <i>Fidelio</i>, a triumph of goodness over evil.

Little management firm, find few common denominators or patterns characterizing the breakthrough process or specific conditions favoring it. Often a combination of ideas, persons, resources, circumstances, timing and serendipity are needed to produce such innovations as Walkman, CAT scan, the ulcer-healing drug Tagamet, microwave ovens and Federal Express. As these engrossing stories testify, some breakthroughs came about because of a need perceived and fulfilled by an individual such as the 50-year-old Arthur Jones whose fervent desire to develop his muscles led to the invention of the Nautilus exercise machines. Other breakthroughs resulted from the shared visions of a team of scientists or engineers and the efforts of several competitive companies like those in Japan that contributed to the development of the VCR. Every breakthrough, the authors conclude, is rooted in someone's obsessive urge to solve a problem. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.This book stems from a project launched by Arthur D. Little, Inc. in observance of its centennial. A team of A.D. Little consultants set out to examine the creative processes in individuals and organizations which have resulted in commercial project breakthroughs. The results are reported in in-depth analyses of the development and marketing of such products as the Walkman, Post-it pads, Chemlawn, and the Cat scanner.

Le Guin ( Searoad: The Chronicles of Klatsand , HarperCollins, 1991) is as expert in creating mellifluous and enchanting essays as she is in creating the luscious and complex worlds of her fiction. Stylistically, she manages a balance between quasi-academic seriousness and conversational humor (a balance that original editor Susan Wood does not attain in her introductions). Despite being three to 13 years out of date, depending on the extent of revision, her comments on the state of the genre, the process of writing, and the influence of gender on literature are as fresh as ever. The book is dated only in its ratio of female to male writers of fantasy and sf, which is now closer than it was when Le Guin first wrote. Highly recommended for all literature and women's studies collections.<br><i>- Keith R.A. DeCan dido, "Library Journal"</i><br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.For Le Guin, writing science fiction or fantasy is an intuitive, self-exploratory act, an inner-space voyage in which she unearths dreams and archetypes that connect her with the outer world. In these conversational, feisty essays, an energizing mind trip for SF fans, she dissects her own fiction, discusses technique and explores the potential of SF and fantasy, which she considers different branches of the same form of writing. Most SF has been regressive and unimaginative, she argues, by portraying authoritarian dystopias instead of democratic socialist societies. She also berates the genre for its marginalization of women, both as fictional characters and as writers. This is essentially a reissue of a 1979 compilation that went out of print in 1982. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>South Carolina Atlas &amp; Gazetteer (Delorme Atlas &amp; Gazetteer)</h2><p>Delorme, a Travel Planning Resource.

By a miracle she's held on to their mountainside farm&#x2014;and she'll keep holding on, no matter what. The property is Nora's one chance to wring some dignity out of the sham she's been living.<br><br>The Vermont locals think she's a city girl on a nature kick, but she's not afraid to get her hands dirty.

A mask she donned to protect herself from the horde of lawyers, accountants, and other corporate hit men who had invaded her life since Mike's death. Most of them were here now, assembled around the massive oak conference table in Mike's office, shuffling papers, murmuring, jotting notes. Their work was done. Like jurors, they were poised to deliver a verdict.<br><br>She sat alone at the far end of the table, one against so many. Nora felt the bulk of her dark wool suit, the high blouse collar like a cinch around her neck. She had chosen the respectable outfit deliberately. Despite the gossip, she would show them that Michael MacKenzie's widow was a lady.<br><br>There was a chill in the morning air. No one had offered her coffee. Clasping her hands tight in her lap, Nora peered from behind her mask to study the men and women who would decide her fate. A few had the air of pompous boredom that she long ago discovered hid incompetence. She recognized those that had played the role of her supporter and those that had taken the attack. There were more of them. A few she had talked to daily for almost a year. Today, however, she was universally ignored. Dismissal was clear in their eyes.<br><br>Ralph Bellows sat across the length of polished wood, his gray hair flowing from his broad forehead like a periwig. Nora knew he would act as judge. Bellows relished the role. A clearing of his throat served as a gavel, and he called his court to order with a firm "Shall we begin?"<br><br>Nora's shoulders tensed. She had no doubt Mike would be found guilty in the eyes of his peers. He had committed the worst of crimes: bungled his finances, destroyed his businesses, and left them without a profit. Yet the one to serve the sentence would be her.<br><br>Straightening in the stiff leather chair, Nora appeared calm and dignified. She offered Bellows a gracious nod.<br><br>"Mrs. MacKenzie...well, we are not strangers in this room. We have endured together a long, arduous year. May I address you as Nora?"<br><br>His smile revealed teeth the color of ripe bananas. Nora nodded again. They'd endured? Nora clenched her hands in bitterness. <em>She </em>had endured. They'd conducted business as usual. No matter how disastrous her estate, they would be assured their pay before creditors got a dime.<br><br>"The untangling of Mike's business dealings has been more complicated than we originally envisioned," Bellows began gravely. "Our work is not yet completed."<br><br>A short gasp escaped from Nora's lips. It had been a year since Mike's suicide. What more could they need to accomplish before settling the estate?<br><br>Reading her frustration, Bellows continued in a conciliatory tone. "No one realizes the futility of further delays more than I. However, to put it bluntly, Michael MacKenzie left behind a mess. No one, least of all family, understood the extent of his holdings. We are doing our best to put together the pieces of his myriad dealings, but some critical bits of information are still missing."<br><br>From under his bushy brows, Bellows's pale eyes searched hers intently. Nora felt like the prey of an owl. She paled, yet steadfastly returned his gaze with the wide eyes of innocence.<br><br>You bet they're missing, she thought from behind her mask. There wasn't a man or a woman at this table who hadn't rifled through every nook and cranny she and Mike possessed. Who hadn't read every personal letter they could find. Who had bothered to ask her permission. There was a frenzy to their search that raised her suspicions and her ire. Even the break-in at her New York apartment disturbed her less than their blatant disregard. Nothing had been stolen, but Mike's desk had been ripped apart.<br><br>"Don't trust anyone." Those were Mike's final words to her, whispered urgently the night before he died. Nora had heeded his words and hidden every paper she could find on his desk.<br><br>Bellows cleared his throat again with a frustrated staccato, glancing at the papers on the table. When he looked up again, his gray eyes were as cold as the rainy sky outside the windows.<br><br>"Even without further information the result is clear." Bellows tapped the report with finality.<br><br>Nora leaned forward, focused on his lips.<br><br>"The bottom line is, the estate is bankrupt."<br><br>Nora blinked. "You mean his <em>business </em>is bankrupt."<br><br>Bellows screwed up his lips under his red bulbous nose.<br><br>"No, I mean <em>you </em>are bankrupt. For all that we loved Mike, he did a stupid thing. He made himself personally liable for his debts."<br><br>Bellows's voice ended abruptly, leaving everyone to finish his thought: <em>and then blew his brains out before pulling himself out.</em><br><br>"What do you mean, personally liable?" Nora asked, reality taking hold. She was fighting to maintain her composure. Suddenly she loathed the alcoholic nose that Bellows peered over.<br><br>"Mr. MacKenzie put up his personal estate as collateral for loans," contributed a young clean-shaven accountant. His voice shook and he fingered his papers nervously. "The family's seventy-five percent stake in MacCorp., personal property&#x2014;he pledged it all. Mike was so deep in hock he was unable to make the repayment schedule."<br><br>Nora did not acknowledge him. The family's stock? What family? There was only her. She had a name. Nora remained rigid in her chair and continued to stare at Bellows.<br><br>"Ralph, what does this mean to me?"<br><br>Bellows's features softened as he laced his fingers together and rested them on the stack of papers before him. Nora wasn't fooled for a moment. Bellows had nothing to lose by offering kindness now.<br><br>"What this means, Nora, is that Mike left you with nothing. Worse than nothing, actually. We have paid back as many of the loans as possible, but you still owe a great deal of money. You will have to sell everything&#x2014;and even then you may still owe."<br><br>"Owe? If everything is gone, how will I pay it?" Her voice was a whisper.<br><br>"The company is in receivership. Your goods will be auctioned off in October by a reputable house. Fortunately, your antiques and art collections are quite rare. Properly managed, the auction should bring in a satisfactory amount."<br><br>"Enough to pay off the debts?"<br><br>"Hopefully. With enough left over to give you a start. These are estimates," he said, opening up the collection of papers in front of him. Immediately, the dozen other people opened their packets. With dread, Nora followed suit.<br><br>"If you direct your attention to the bottom of page three," Bellows continued, "you will see the amount I believe we can salvage for you from the estate."<br><br>Nora quickly flipped to the third page and read, then reread the dollar figure they had allotted for her. It was less than she had imagined, and she had imagined a scant amount. Surely there was an error somewhere. She scanned the other fourteen pages of notes carefully, ignoring the impatient sighs and tapping fingers. The report listed, with astonishing accuracy, her personal possessions and their estimated worth: houses, cars, jewels, furniture, art.<br><br>"You even list the few personal possessions that I brought to the marriage." She indicated the report with an exasperated flip of her hand. "My grandmother's jewelry, for example. It may not be worth much monetarily, but to me&#x2014;" her voice almost cracked and she swallowed hard "&#x2014;to me, they are priceless."<br><br>"I'm sorry, Nora." Bellows shrugged, running his fingers down the columns. "Maybe we could take out a few...less valuable items." He seemed embarrassed now.<br><br>"This is wrong," Nora said, deeply feeling the injustice.<br><br>"It was Mike's doing."<br><br>A familiar ache gripped Nora's heart. Her feelings lay somewhere between anguish and anger. They made her breath come short. Calm yourself, she told herself. Get through this last step and you will be free from the lot of them forever.<br><br>"I don't blame Mike," she lied. "What I don't understand is how he could appear so successful and suddenly I learn he is bankrupt. How did it get this bad?"<br><br>Bellows's look implied all that he did not say, all that everyone already knew. That she had left Mike. How, their eyes accused, could she expect to know about Mike's finances after she walked out on him? Left him in his hour of need? Nora knew they saw her as the New York socialite who collected antiques and art. A pretty blonde who couldn't be bothered with bank balances.<br><br>Nora looked at the accusing eyes and despite her vow, shrank inward. Guilt was an unwelcome shroud for a widow to bear. It kept one mourning without resolved grief. Deserved or not, it was a heavy burden. If Mike had died naturally, perhaps she could have escaped it. He had chosen suicide, however, and with that final act he had completed his seven-year campaign of verbal abuse. Nora's hand moved to rub her brow, but she arrested the gesture in her lap. She tightened her fists and raised her chin.<br><br>"He took a new direction in his last year," Bellows explained.<br><br>"This 'new direction' is not detailed in the report," she replied icily.<br><br>Bellows raised his brows. "Quite right. The purpose of today's meeting is only to explain the status of your estate prior to settlement."<br><br>"Since my money seems to have been lost as well, I should think I am entitled to a full disclosure."<br><br>Mumbles sounded at the table. Nora still focused on Bellows. Always work at the top, Mike had said.<br><br>She sensed a new appreciation in Bellows's eyes. Up until now, her encounters with him had been purely social. Despite his gentlemanly facade, his hand always seemed to find a way to her waist. In what might have appeared a mindless motion, the broad expanse of his palm would caress her ribs while his long thumb would nudge upward toward her breast. Beneath his fastidious apparel, Nora always found him dirty.<br><br>"I'd be happy to set up a private meeting to outline Mike's past projects, Nora." Bellows's voice projected the cooperating attorney. His rheumy eyes spoke of another project he had in mind, and to emphasize his intent, he presented her with a magnanimous smile. Be good to me, the smile said, and I'll be good to you.<br><br>"That won't be necessary," she replied firmly. "A report in the mail should suffice. I plan to leave town as soon as possible."<br><br>Thirteen pairs of brows rose in unison.<br><br>"Leave? To where, my dear?" Bellows asked.<br><br>Truth was, she didn't know. Anywhere but here, Nora thought, her gaze traveling across the impassive faces surrounding her. She'd had enough of false friendship. She'd had her fill of dismissal and rejection, of sympathy with strings attached. Somewhere along the line, she'd lost sight of her values. Looking back, she couldn't remember what it was she had hoped to achieve by thirty.<br><br>This was a turning point. Nora wanted to go somewhere she could work hard, earn her own living, and reevaluate her values. Somewhere, she wanted to build a life that mattered.<br><br>Nora's hand stilled in her lap. An entry from the report came to mind with a flash. Such a place existed, she realized, a smile escaping from her rigid control. Excitement bubbled. She knew exactly where that place was.<br><br>Leaving Bellows's question hanging, Nora dove into the report and began flipping quickly through the pages.<br><br>"I assure you we went through everything thoroughly," an attractive woman lawyer commented.<br><br>"I'm sure you have," Nora replied tersely. She remembered the blonde from the "attack" team. Nora ran her finger along the listed property, unconsciously holding her breath. When she spotted what she was looking for, her breath exhaled with a satisfying gasp. The estimated value was fairly low.<br><br>"Looking for anything in particular?" asked Bellows, his interest clearly piqued.<br><br>"Just one moment, please," Nora replied without looking up. Grabbing a pencil she made notations, referring back to page three. Always facile with numbers, Nora reviewed the estimated values, made a few more notations, and calculated an alternative plan.<br><br>When she looked up again, the twelve lawyers and accountants were slouched in their chairs in exaggerated poses of boredom. Their noses seemed to have grown inches, the way they peered down at her from behind them. Nora coughed back a laugh. Only Bellows viewed her with intense interest.<br><br>"I'll take the Vermont farm instead of the cash," she announced.<br><br>Twelve chairs creaked as the men and women snapped to attention and shuffled through their papers.<br><br>Bellows seemed both amused and curious. "The sheep farm? But why, Nora? It is a small operation, risky at best. Its only purpose for Mike was as a tax write-off."<br><br>"All true," she replied, holding back her excitement.<br><br>His eyes narrowed. "I believe the house is unfinished. Have you and Mike ever lived there?"<br><br>"No," she said emphatically. "Never."<br><br>"I see," he replied, leaning back in his chair. His eyes never left her. "Then why the farm?"<br><br>"Why not?" She wasn't about to confide in Uncle Ralph. "I want it," she said bluntly, "and according to my calculations, I can have it&#x2014;plus enough to establish an interest-bearing account of about three hundred thousand dollars. That should give me enough to eke out a living." "A meager living, to be sure."<br><br>"I'm not afraid," she lied again. As he went through her figures, adding a few of his own, Nora maintained her icy composure. She could not let on how much this meant to her.<br><br>"I don't want any surprises," she said. "Not without a cushion. I assume your calculations are correct?"<br><br>An indignant <em>harumph </em>sounded from her left as an accountant's face mottled. Nora focused only on Bellows. This was between the two of them, Mike's personal lawyer and his widow.<br><br>She could sense the growing surprise and antagonism of the men and women around her. These were Mike's people. She, his wife, was the outsider.<br><br>And that was the way she wanted it. Her foot began tapping beneath the heavy table as she put together the pieces of her new, even radical plan. In her mind she could envision the farm the last time she saw it&#x2014;what was it&#x2014;three years ago? The verdant lushness of the Vermont mountains, the fat red raspberries hanging ripe on the bush, fields of oxeye daisies, Queen Anne's lace and clover sprouting up between rocks, dark woods with cool breezes, and the bucolic bleating of the lambs. It could all be hers. She could make something of her life there, she felt sure of it.<br><br>A heady kind of enthusiasm raced through her no-longer-complacent veins. An excitement that ran slipshod over her rational constraints, delivering a new confidence. The kind that in the past had inspired her to impulsively buy a piece of furniture, or a painting. Though based on knowledge, the decision was instinct. She was born with what some people called "a knack."<br><br>She had to have the farm, she thought with quiet desperation. It was right. And it was all she had to hold on to.<br><br>Bellows cleared his throat, once again bringing his court into session. "Well," he said with both resignation and mirth. "I see no reason why this can't be arranged."<br><br>Amid the grumbling of disapproval at the table, Nora beamed.<br><br></p><h2>Common Sense, The Rights of Man, and Other Essential Writings of Thomas Paine</h2><p>Offers the complete text of &#34;Common Sense&#34; and &#34;The Rights of Man,&#34; along with selections from other writings of the eighteenth century firebrand.</p><p><b>Thomas Paine</b> was born in Thetford, England, in 1737, the son of a staymaker. He had little schooling and worked at a number of jobs, including tax collector, a position he lost for agitating for an increase in excisemens pay. Persuaded by Benjamin Franklin, he emigrated to America in 1774. In 1776 he began his <b>American Crisis</b> series of thirteen pamphlets, and also published the incalculably influential <b>Common Sense</b>, which established Paine not only as a truly revolutionary thinker, but as the American Revolutions fiercest political theorist. In 1787 Paine returned to Europe, where he became involved in revolutionary politics. In England his books were burned by the public hangman. Escaping to France, Paine took part in drafting the French constitution and voted against the kings execution. He was imprisoned for a year and narrowly missed execution himself. In 1802 he returned to America and lived in New York State, poor, ill and largely despised for his extremism and so-called atheism (he was in fact a deist). Thomas Paine died in 1809. His body was exhumed by William Cobbett, and the remains were taken to England for a memorial burial.

Hell, it turns out, is an underground world where a nasty race of humanoids called hadals lived for millennia, occasionally coming to the surface and wreaking havoc. In The Descent, the hadals were wiped out, or so we thought. Now, 10 years later, humans have colonized the Subterrain, but they're about to find out that some hadals have survived and that you can't really kill Satan. At least as exciting as its predecessor, this flashy, fast-paced sequel features a motley crew of characters&#x2014;including one of the human survivors of the last novel, Ali Von Schade, who ventures deep into hell to rescue children who were abducted from the surface. In addition to Ali, the characters include a NASA researcher who spent two years exploring hell and who now has massive physical deformities, including a pair of horns; the mother of one of the missing children, whose journey into the Subterrain takes an unexpected toll on her; a filmmaker who disappeared into hell several years ago and who seems to have survived its perils; and a Navy SEAL sniper. Long has a knack for telling stories with inherently over-the-top premises, but he tells them so well and with such passion that we are brought totally under his spell. His characters are real and complex, his dialogue sharp, and his narrative stylish and frightening. This is one case where readers should be enthusiastically encouraged to go to hell.

Yet, this 28-gun frigate also had an eventful real career serving in both the French and then the Royal Navies. It was captured from the French in 1796 and took part in the famous cutting-out action on the frigate HMS <em>Hermione</em>, which the Spanish had taken after a savage mutiny. In 1802, after the Peace of Amiens, HMS <em>Surprise</em> was decommissioned and delivered into the fictional captaincy of Jack Aubrey.This sumptuous new volume narrates the career of HMS <em>Surprise</em> in both her historical and her fictional roles and presents an all-embracing construction and fitting history. In addition to historical illustrations, maps, artifacts, and photographs, thirty-five paintings, some specially commissioned, have been contributed by Geoff Hunt, whose art graces the covers of Patrick O&#x2019;Brian&#x2019;s Aubrey-Maturin novels.

Richburg was an experienced and respected reporter who had paid his dues covering urban neighborhoods in Washington D.C., and won praise for his coverage of Southeast Asia. But nothing prepared him for the personal odyssey that he would embark upon when he was assigned to cover Africa.In this powerful book, Richburg takes the reader on an extraordinary journey that sweeps from Somalia to Rwanda to Zaire and finally to South Africa. He shows how he came to terms with the divide within himself: between his African racial heritage and his American cultural identity.Are these really my people? Am I truly an African-American? The answer, Richburg finds, after much soul-searching, is that no, he is not an African, but an American first and foremost. To those who romanticize Mother Africa as a black Valhalla, where blacks can walk with dignity and pride, he regrets that this is not the reality. He has been there and witnessed the killings, the repression, the false promises, and the horror. Thank God my nameless ancestor, brought across the ocean in chains and leg irons, made it out alive,&#x201d; he concludes. Thank God I am an American.&#x201d;</p><p>From 1991 to 1994, Keith Richburg was based in Nairobi as the Africa bureau chief for the <i>Washington Post</i>. He traveled throughout Africa, from Rwanda to Zaire, witnessing and reporting on wars, famines, mass murders, and the complexity and corruption of African politics. Unlike many black Americans who romanticize Africa, Richburg looks back on his time there and concludes that he is simply an American, not an African American. This is a powerful, hard-hitting book, filled with anguished soul-searching as Richburg makes his way toward that uncomfortable conclusion.Keith B.

Putting him at the center of a new generation of leading men emerging in the early 1990s&#x2014; including Johnny Depp, Keanu Reeves, Brad Pitt, Nicolas Cage, and Leonardo DiCaprio&#x2014;Gavin Edwards traces the Academy Award nominee&#x2019;s meteoric rise, couches him in an examination of the 1990s, and illuminates his lasting legacy on Hollywood and popular culture itself.</p></p><p><p>Hollywood was built on beautiful and complicated matinee idols: James Dean and Marlon Brando are classic examples, but in the 1990s, the actor who embodied that archetype was River Phoenix. As the brightly colored 1980s wound down, a new crew of leading men began to appear on movie screens. Hailed for their acting prowess and admired for choosing meaty roles, actors such as Johnny Depp, Nicolas Cage, Keanu Reeves, and Brad Pitt were soon rocketing toward stardom while an unknown Leonardo DiCaprio prepared to make his acting debut. River Phoenix, however, stood in front of the pack. Blessed with natural talent and fueled by integrity, Phoenix was admired by his peers and adored by his fans. More than just a pinup on teenage girls' walls, Phoenix was also a fervent defender of the environment and a vocal proponent of a vegan lifestyle&#x2014;well on his way to becoming a symbol of his generation. At age eighteen, he received his first Oscar nomination. But behind his beautiful public face, there was a young man who had been raised in a cult by nonconformist parents, who was burdened with supporting his family from a young age, and who eventually succumbed to addiction, escaping into a maelstrom of drink and drugs. </p><p>And then he was gone. After a dozen films, including <em>Stand by Me</em> and <em>My Own Private Idaho</em>, and with a seemingly limitless future, River Phoenix died of a drug overdose. He was twenty-three years old. </p><p>In <em>Last Night at the Viper Room</em>, bestselling author and journalist Gavin Edwards toggles between the tragic events at the Viper Room in West Hollywood on Halloween 1993 and the story of an extraordinary life. <em>Last Night at the Viper Room</em> is part biography, part cultural history of the 1990s, and part celebration of River Phoenix, a Hollywood icon gone too soon. Full of interviews from his fellow actors, directors, friends, and family, <em>Last Night at the Viper Room</em> shows the role he played in creating the place of the actor in our modern culture and the impact his work still makes today.</p><p>Gavin Edwards is a contributing editor at <em>Rolling Stone</em> who has written five articles for the magazine about Blink-182 for the magazine since 1999. He is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of seven books.

Their principal foe, apart from that behemoth, is the fundamentalist preacher Dudley Love, the mastermind behind uranium mines, power plants, and other insults to Abbey's beloved desert. Abbey has great fun lampooning the pretensions of environmental activists, New Agers ("vee put flowers on zee Big Bucket, vee put flowers on zee driver's neck and hug heem? her? it? and kiss and luff and squeeze and make GOLIATH stop," says one starry-eyed European crystal gazer), and developers alike as he unfolds his tale of a motorized Wild West and its latter-day outlaw heroes.

As far as <strong>Washington was concerned, slavery only made the black person stronger. He argued that both blacks and whites would benefit more from giving blacks vocational training than from encouraging the &#x201c;craze for Greek &amp; Latin learning.&#x201d; While this set him at odds with other black leaders of his time, such as W.E. B. Du Bois, it also set the groundwork for Washington&#x2019;s Tuskegee Institute to be the best-funded black educational institution of its era.<br></strong></p><p>Nineteenth-century African American businessman, activist, and educator Booker Taliaferro Washington's <i>Up from Slavery</i> is one of the greatest American autobiographies ever written. Its mantras of black economic empowerment, land ownership, and self-help inspired generations of black leaders, including Marcus Garvey, Elijah Muhammad, Malcolm X, and Louis Farrakhan. In rags-to-riches fashion, Washington recounts his ascendance from early life as a mulatto slave in Virginia to a 34-year term as president of the influential, agriculturally based Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. From that position, Washington reigned as the most important leader of his people, with slogans like "cast down your buckets," which emphasized vocational merit rather than the academic and political excellence championed by his contemporary rival W.E.B. Du Bois. Though many considered him too accommodating to segregationists, Washington, as he said in his historic "Atlanta Compromise" speech of 1895, believed that "political agitation alone would not save [the Negro]," and that "property, industry, skill, intelligence, and character" would prove necessary to black Americans' success. The potency of his philosophies are alive today in the nationalist and conservative camps that compose the complex quilt of black American society.This book is in Electronic Paperback Format.

In <i>Patrimony, </i>fans will learn more about their favorite redhead&#x2014;with emerald eyes, uncanny powers, and a poisonous minidrag&#x2014;than they ever dreamed possible.</b><br><br> &#x201c;I know who your father is . . . Gestalt.&#x201d; A shocked Flinx hears these dying words from one of the renegade eugenicists whose experiments with humans twenty-odd years ago shocked the galaxy . . . and spawned Flinx. So Flinx and his minidrag, Pip, venture to Gestalt, an out-of-the-way planet perfect for someone who never wants to be found&#x2014;disregarding the advice of those who think Flinx could make better use of his time locating the ancient, sentient weapons platform that could be the galaxy&#x2019;s only chance of stopping the exterminating scourge that&#x2019;s fast approaching. Flinx might agree with them&#x2014;but the quest for patrimony wins out. (Sorry, galaxy!)<br><br> Could Gestalt supply the key to Flinx&#x2019;s shadowy past and strange powers? An eccentric loner in a remote area could be the father Flinx has never stopped searching for, perhaps the only person who can unravel the mystery of his birth and his amazing, agonizing powers.&nbsp;<br><br> Unfortunately for Flinx, Gestalt also hosts a resident bounty hunter who&#x2019;s just learned about the stupendous reward offered for a certain dead redhead. Flinx gets a chance to test his adversary&#x2019;s skills when our hero&#x2019;s skimmer is blasted out of the sky and into a raging river in the middle of nowhere&#x2014;a nowhere of impassable terrain and ravenous, carnivorous beasts. <br><br> But hey, what&#x2019;s one more impossible challenge for someone who&#x2019;s spent his life defying the odds and escaping the inescapable? Flinx has one thing going for him . . . plenty of experience.</p><p>Alan Dean Foster has written in a variety of genres, including hard science fiction, fantasy, horror, detective, western, historical, and contemporary fiction. He is the author of the New York Times bestseller Star Wars: The Approaching Storm and the popular Pip &amp; Flinx novels, as well as novelizations of several films including Transformers, Star Wars, the first three Alien films, and Alien Nation. His novel Cyber Way won the Southwest Book Award for Fiction in 1990, the first science fiction work ever to do so. Foster and his wife, JoAnn Oxley, live in Prescott, Arizona, in a house built of brick that was salvaged from an early-twentieth-century miners&#x2019; brothel. He is currently at work on several new novels and media projects.CHAPTER 1<br><br><i>Make the right moves. <br></i><br>Easy for an Ulru-Ujurrian to say, Flinx reflected as the <i>Teacher </i>maintained its approach to the world that lay at the end of the decelerating KK-drive craft&#x2019;s present course. Easy for an Ulru-Ujurrian to do. But then, everything was easy for an Ulru-Ujurrian to say and do. Unimaginably powerful, preposterously playful, and possessed of talents as yet unmeasured&#x2013;and quite possibly unmeasurable&#x2013;they went about their daily activities without a care in the world&#x2013;short of keeping busy by way of the unfathomable playtime that involved moving their planet closer to its sun. <br><br>Even that bit of outrageous astrophysics seemed simpler to Flinx than unraveling the mystery of his origins. <br><br>He had been given a clue. For the first time in many seemingly interminable years, a tangible clue. And even more than that, he had been provided with a destination. It lay before him now, a world he had never considered before, lying the same distance from his present position as his homeworld of Moth or, in a different direction, New Riviera and Clarity Held. <br><br>Clarity, Clarity. Under the proficient ministrations and attentive guardianship of his old friends Bran Tse-Mallory and Truzenzuzex, she would be recovering from the injuries she had sustained during the fight that had allowed him to successfully flee New Riviera, also known as Nur. While his love was healing physically, perhaps he could finally heal the open wound of his unknown origins. These chafed and burned within him as intensely as any cancer. <br><br><i>Gestalt</i>. <br><br>A word bursting with meaning. Perhaps also a <i>world </i>full of meaning, as it was the name of the globe his ship was rapidly approaching. An undistinguished colony world, H Class VIII, with a single large moon whose orbit the <i>Teacher </i>was presently cutting. Home to a native species called the Tlel, as well as to a modest complement of human colonists. Rather eccentric human colonists, if the details contained within the galographic he had perused were to be believed. Not that he expected to interact very much with the general population. He was here to find something specific. Something for which he had been searching a long, long time, without any real hope of ever finding it. Now, for the first time in years, he had hope. <br><br>That is, he did if what he had been told was not a cynical dying man&#x2019;s final provocation&#x2013;a last lie intended to exact a final measure of revenge on the youth responsible for his death. <br><br><i>I know who your father is, </i>Theon al-bar Cocarol had wheezed on Visaria just prior to dying. Self-proclaimed sole unmindwiped survivor of the renegade, edicted eugenicist Meliorare Society, he had dubbed Flinx <i>Experiment Twelve-A </i>before gasping out <i>Gestalt! </i>and then inconveniently expiring. <i>Experiments are not supposed to have knowledge of their biological progenitors, </i>he had coldly insisted earlier.<br> <br>To the Great Emptiness with that, Flinx had decided immediately. In his lifelong search for his origins he had pursued more than his share of dead ends. It would only be one more irony in a life filled to bursting with them if a lead supplied by a dying outlaw turned out to be the right one. <br><br>Equally important had been the expiring scientist&#x2019;s choice of words. <i>I know who your father is, </i>Cocarol had declaimed before gasping his last. Penultimate breath or not, Flinx had not confused the tense. Cocarol had clearly and unmistakably said &#x201c;is.&#x201d; Not <i>was, </i>but <i>is</i>. So small a word, so full of promise. Was it possible, Flinx had been unable to keep himself from musing ever since that critical, piercing moment, that he might not only finally learn the identity of his father, but actually find him alive? It was too much to hope for. <br><br>So he did not hope. He had been disappointed too often before. But he allowed himself, had to allow himself, space in which to wish. <br><br>Intent on the fate of the galaxy and every one of its inhabitants civilized or otherwise, his mentors Bran Tse-Mallory and the Eint Truzenzuzex would almost certainly not have sympathized with his present detour. Much as she loved him, Clarity might not have sympathized, either. But she would have understood. Even with the fate of so much and so many at stake, there were private demons that had to be put to rest before Flinx could fully focus on external threats, no matter how vast in extent they might be. Save the inner universe first, he kept telling himself, and you&#x2019;re likely to be in better condition to make a stab at saving everything else. <br><br>Sprawled like a length of pink-and-green rope below the <i>Teacher</i>&#x2019;s foreport, Pip lifted her head to glance across at him. Epitomizing the empathetic bond that existed between them, the minidrag&#x2019;s attitude reflected her friend and master&#x2019;s anguish. <br><br>&#x201c;Am I selfish?&#x201d; he asked the ship, after explicating his disquiet aloud. <br><br>&#x201c;Of course you are.&#x201d; The <i>Teacher</i>&#x2019;s ship-mind had been programmed for many things. Subtlety was not to be counted among them. &#x201c;The fate of a galaxy rests in your hands. Or rather, in lieu of a cheap analogy, in your mind.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Uh-huh. Assuming I exist in this hypothetical position to do anything at all about it, notwithstanding what Bran and Tru seem to think.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;In the absence of an alternative specifically encouraging, they seek surcease in the exploration of remote possibilities. Of which you are, like it or not, ostensibly the most promising.&#x201d; <br><br>Flinx nodded. Rising from the command chair, he strolled over to the manual console and absently ran his hand down the length of Pip&#x2019;s back. The flying snake quivered with pleasure. <br><br>&#x201c;What do <i>you </i>think?&#x201d; he asked softly. &#x201c;<i>Am </i>I the last hope? Am I the key to something bigger, something more powerful, that visits me in dreams? Or whatever you want to call that perversely altered state of consciousness in which I sometimes unwillingly find myself.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I do not know,&#x201d; the <i>Teacher </i>told him honestly. &#x201c;I serve, without pretending to understand. I can take you wherever you wish to go, except to comprehension. That destination is not programmed into me.&#x201d; <br><br>Mechanical soul, Flinx thought. Not designed to pronounce judgment. In lieu of the advice of a superior intellect, he would have to judge himself. With a sigh, he raised one hand and gestured toward the port. Soon they would need to announce themselves to planetary control with an eye toward taking up orbit. <br><br>&#x201c;What about this change of course? What do you think of my putting aside the hunt for the Tar-Aiym weapons platform in order to search for my father here, based on what the dying Meliorare told me?&#x201d; <br><br>Understanding of certain matters might not have been programmed into the <i>Teacher</i>&#x2019;s ship-mind, but contempt was. &#x201c;An insupportable waste of time. I have run a number of calculations based on the facts and variables available to me. The results are less than promising. Consider: the human Cocarol may have simply been enjoying a final, embittered joke at your expense. Or he may not have known what he was talking about. If he did, circumstances may have changed since he was last conversant with the issue at hand. Since then, any knowledge he may have possessed concerning the identity or location of your male parent may have changed radically. <br><br>&#x201c;Meanwhile, whatever lies behind the Great Emptiness continues this way. It is my opinion that your time would be better spent searching for the absent, ancient Tar-Aiym weapons platform that represents the only hope, thus far, of a device even theoretically powerful enough to counter the oncoming danger. A device with whom only you have had, and can initiate, mental contact.&#x201d; The silken yet tart mechanical voice paused briefly. &#x201c;Have I at least succeeded in instigating within you a modicum of guilt?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;The attempt is redundant,&#x201d; Flinx snapped. &#x201c;No need to refresh that which never leaves me.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;That realization, at least, is encouraging,&#x201d; the ship replied. &#x201c;Since logic and reason are having no effect, I search for that which <i>will </i>work.&#x201d; <br><br>In some respects chatting with the <i>Teacher </i>was easier than engaging in conversation with a human. For example, the ship never raised its voice, and if Flinx so wished, he could terminate the discussion with a simple command. On the other hand, unlike with another person, he could not turn away from it. The ship-mind was everywhere around him. <br><br>&#x201c;As soon as I&#x2019;ve settled this question, I&#x2019;ll resume the search. I promise.&#x201d; Pip looked up at him quizzically. <br>The ship responded, &#x201c;What makes you so certain that you will settle it here? This is a question the answer to which you have sought on many worlds. As I have commented repeatedly, the dying human could have perished with a falsehood on his lips. It would not be overmuch to expect of one who had so long lived a lie himself.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I know, I know.&#x201d; A pensive Flinx raised his gaze once more to the cloud-swathed new world looming steadily larger in the foreport. As he stared, the port continuously adapted to the changing light outside the ship. Another new world in a long list of those that instead of answers had thus far provided him with only more questions. &#x201c;But after all these years, it&#x2019;s the most promising lie that I&#x2019;ve been told.&#x201d; <br><br>Though Gestalt&#x2019;s human population numbered only in the millions, he was still surprised at the informality that infused the exchange of arrival formalities. According to the <i>Teacher, </i>the orbiting station-based automatic electronic protocol that challenged their approach did not even bother to inquire as to the nature of his business. This suggested that the planetary authority was either lazy, indifferent, or criminally negligent. As it developed, it was none of these. Orbital insertion protocol was a true reflection of the colonists&#x2019; attitude and philosophy. It was not quite like anything Flinx had encountered before. <br><br>The lack of bureaucratic ceremony meant that he had to conceal only his true identity, and not the configuration of his vessel. The <i>Teacher </i>was able to avoid having to employ the complex external morphing he usually had to order it to undergo to disguise its appearance when visiting other worlds. <br><br>After equipping himself as best he could from ship stores according to the recommendations that were included in Gestalt&#x2019;s unpretentious but thorough galographics file, he headed down the corridor that led to the shuttle bay. Riding his left shoulder beneath his dark brown nanofiber cold-weather jacket, Pip had gone to sleep. A quick predeparture check indicated that everything was in place for him to take his usual leave from the vessel. The communit that would not only allow him to communicate with the <i>Teacher </i>but also allow it to keep track of him was secure in its pouch on his duty belt, which was itself concealed beneath the lower hem of the jacket. <br><br>Though not an iceworld like Tran-ky-ky, by all indications the surface of Gestalt was as chilly as a Meliorare&#x2019;s heart. It would, he reflected, be a change from all the temperate, tropical, and semidesert worlds on which he had recently spent so much of his time. <br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be back soon,&#x201d; he declared aloud as the shuttle lock door curled softly shut behind him. A slight hiss signified pressure equalization. <br><br>&#x201c;Famous last words,&#x201d; the <i>Teacher </i>murmured, addressing the observation as much to itself as to the lanky young human who was now slipping into harness inside the shuttle. <br><br><i>My father, </i>Flinx thought to himself as he felt the subtle jolt that indicated the shuttle had dropped clear of the <i>Teacher</i>. My father <i>is</i>. So had insisted the dying Meliorare Cocarol. So many years spent searching. So much time lost wondering. Finding his father would not save civilization from the vast abyssal horror that was speeding toward the Milky Way from beyond the Great Emptiness&#x2013;but it might help to fortify the hesitant, vacillating key that was himself. <br><br>In all his traveling he had never seen a planetary surface quite like that of Gestalt. Its waters were blue, its heavy cloud cover mottled white. Normal enough. But instead of ambiguous, perambulating scattering, the numerous continental landmasses ran north to south in roughly parallel, scimitar-shaped arcs, striping the entire globe with mountainous chevrons. Some of the larger bodies of land were loosely connected by wandering, thin strips of terrain, while others were completely isolated from one another by long stretches of open sea. <br><br>Each individual landmass consisted largely of rugged mountain ranges that had been squeezed up from the planetary crust by grumbling tectonic forces. There should be active volcanism, Flinx mused as he studied the surface that was rising swiftly toward him. Indeed, in the course of the descent he spotted several confessional plumes, their telltale trails stretching out straight and sharp as white feathers amid the rest of what was an otherwise typically anarchic atmosphere. <br><br>As the shuttle automatically leveled off on final approach, he marveled at the landscape that spread out in every direction. Valleys cutting through the incessant mountain chains flashed churning rivers. Bright flashes of alpine lakes lay strung like shards of shattered mirror among the green. And, startlingly, the blue. There was an inordinate amount of undeniably blue vegetation, he saw, in every imaginable shade and variation. In addition, the snow that capped the higher peaks and lay like cotton in shadowed vales and chasms was tinted a distinctive pink that occasionally deepened to rose. There must be something unique in the composition of the local precipitates, he reflected. <br><br>Finding one&#x2019;s way around such country would be next to impossible without modern technology. As the <i>Teacher</i>&#x2019;s shuttle sped over valley after valley, dropping gradually lower and lower, he saw that one rocky, tree-fringed gorge looked much like another. Infrequently, a cluster of structures indicating organized habitation impinged briefly on his vision. Even at the shuttle&#x2019;s rapidly diminishing landing speed, these came and went too fast for him to tell if their origin was human or indigenous. <br><br>According to Gestalt&#x2019;s galographics, population centers of any kind were few and far between. Both the native Tlel and the humans who had settled among them favored their privacy. It was a trait inborn among the natives and elective among the humans. <br><br>The shuttle&#x2019;s voice, a modest echo of its starship parent, advised him to prepare for touchdown. It was a warning he always took seriously, even when preparing to land on a developed world. He had been prepared for touchdown ever since he had first settled into the seat. Sensing his heightened anticipation, Pip tensed slightly beneath the cold-climate jacket. <br><br>Only a few valleys on Gestalt were wide and flat enough to allow for the siting of a shuttleport. Tlearandra was located on the other side of the planet. Since it was also home to the offices of Gestalt&#x2019;s Commonwealth representative and the preponderance of potentially inquisitive secondary officials, Flinx had prudently chosen to land at Tlossene, the other principal metropolitan area. <br><br>Used to touching d...</p><h2>The Nick Adams stories</h2><p>A great Heminway first edition.</p><p><b>Ernest Hemingway</b> ranks as the most famous of twentieth-century American writers; like Mark Twain, Hemingway is one of those rare authors most people know about, whether they have read him or not. The difference is that Twain, with his white suit, ubiquitous cigar, and easy wit, survives in the public imagination as a basically, lovable figure, while the deeply imprinted image of Hemingway as rugged and macho has been much less universally admired, for all his fame. Hemingway has been regarded less as a writer dedicated to his craft than as a man of action who happened to be afflicted with genius. When he won the Nobel Prize in 1954, <i>Time</i> magazine reported the news under Heroes rather than Books and went on to describe the author as "a globe-trotting expert on bullfights, booze, women, wars, big game hunting, deep sea fishing, and courage." Hemingway did in fact address all those subjects in his books, and he acquired his expertise through well-reported acts of participation as well as of observation; by going to all the wars of his time, hunting and fishing for great beasts, marrying four times, occasionally getting into fistfights, drinking too much, and becoming, in the end, a worldwide celebrity recognizable for his signature beard and challenging physical pursuits.<b>Preface</b><p>"Of the place where he had been a boy he had written well enough. As well as he could then." So thought a dying writer in an early version of "The Snows of Kilimanjaro." The writer of course was Hemingway. The place was the Michigan of his boyhood summers, where he remembered himself as Nick Adams. As well as be could write then was very well indeed.</p><p>Until now, however, the stories involving Nick have always appeared so many to a book, in jumbled sequence. As a result the coherence of his adventures has been obscured, and their impact fragmented. In <i>Men Without Women,</i> Hemingway's second collection of stories, Nick appears first as a soldier in Italy, next as an adolescent in Summit, Illinois, then in turn as a younger boy in Michigan, a married man in Austria, and a soldier back in Italy. Or consider the trouble with "Big Two-Hearted River," one of the best-known Hemingway stories. Placed where it was -- at the end of <i>In Our Time,</i> the first collection -- it puzzled a good many readers. Put where it goes chronologically, following the stories of World War I, its submerged tensions -- the impression that Nick is exorcising some nameless anxiety -- become perfectly understandable. But "A Way You'll Never Be," which precedes "Big Two-Hearted River" in time and explains it, was published eight years and several books after it.</p><p>Arranged in chronological sequence, the events of Nick's life make up a meaningful narrative in which a memorable character grows from child to adolescent to soldier, veteran, writer, and parent -- a sequence closely paralleling the events of Hemingway's own life. In this arrangement Nick Adams, who for a long time was not widely recognized as a consistent character at all, emerges clearly as the first in a long line of Hemingway's fictional selves. Later versions, from Jake Barnes and Frederic Henry to Richard Cantwell and Thomas Hudson, were all to have behind them part of Nick's history and, correspondingly, part of Hemingway's.</p><p>As is true for many writers of fiction, the relationship between Hemingway's work and the events of his own life is an immediate and intricate one. In some stories he appears to report details of actual experience as faithfully as he might have entered them in a diary. In others the play of his imagination has transformed experience into a new and different reality. Exploring the connections between actuality and fiction in Hemingway can be an absorbing activity, and readers who wish to pursue it are referred to the biographical studies listed at the end of this preface. But Hemingway naturally intended his stories to be understood and enjoyed without regard for such considerations -- as they have been for a long time.</p><p>The first Nick Adams fiction appeared almost a half-century ago, the last in 1933, and over the years a great deal has been written about it. Among the unpublished manuscripts Hemingway left behind him, however, eight new contributions to the over-all narrative were discovered. Presented here for the first time, inserted in the places in time where the events fall, they are varied in length and apparent purpose. Three accounts -- of how the Indians left the country of Nick's boyhood, of his first sight of the Mississippi, and of what happened just before and after his wedding -- are quite brief. If the author had larger plans for any of them, such are unknown; they might be read simply as sketches in an artist's notebook. In two other cases his plans are self-evident, for here we have the beginnings of works that were never completed. Nick on board the <i>Chicago,</i> bound for France during World War I, was the start of a novel called <i>Along with Youth</i> that was abandoned long ago. Similarly, though much later, the plot of "The Last Good Country" was left in mid-air, and many pages would have been required to resolve it. Two other pieces are known to have originated in Nick stories already published. "Three Shots" tells how the young boy became frightened while on a camping trip. It once preceded the story called "Indian Camp." And Nick's "stream of consciousness" reflections on his writing career once (anachronistically) concluded "Big Two-Hearted River." Of these new works only "Summer People," very likely the first fiction Hemingway wrote about Nick Adams, can be regarded as a full-length, completed story.</p><p>To distinguish them from previously published works, all the new materials in this book have been printed in a special "oblique" type. If the decision to publish them at all is questioned, justification is available. For one thing, the plan for rearranging the Nick Adams stories coherently benefits from material that fills substantial gaps in the narrative. Further, all this new fiction relates in one way or another to events in the author's life, in which his readers continue to be interested. Last and most important is the fact that these pieces throw new light on the work and personality of one of our foremost writers and genuinely increase our understanding of him. The typography suggests an oblique introduction, but a warm reception is expected.</p><p>-- PHILIP YOUNG</p><p>Preface copyright � 1972 by Charles Scribner's Sons</p></p><h2>Who Was Andrew Jackson?</h2><p><b>Controversial in his day and still controversial now, President Andrew Jackson left his mark on American history.<br><br></b>Seventh President Andrew Jackson was a man of contradictions: quick tempered and brash, he often seemed to look for fights, but he was so devoted to his wife, he quit Congress twice to be by her side. He was a celebrated war hero who nevertheless most enjoyed his serene life in Tennessee. &nbsp;Although he saw himself as a champion of the poor, he grew to be a rich plantation owner owning many slaves. He adopted a young Native American as his son despite ordering the expulsion of tribes &#x2014;hundreds of thousands of people&#x2014;from their homeland in the Southeast. Douglas Yacka captures the many sides of Andrew Jackson, whose life began just before the Revolution and ended not long before the Civil War.<br><br>This book in the<i> New York Times</i> best-selling series contains eighty illustrations that help bring the story to life.</p><p>Douglas Yacka is the author of <i>Eat, Drink, and Be Mad Libs</i> and co-author of <i>Give My Regards to Mad Libs</i>.<b>Who Was Andrew Jackson?</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was still dark on the morning of January 8, 1815. In an army camp just outside of New Orleans, Louisiana, General Andrew Jackson sat alone in his tent. He had a very important decision to make. Andrew either had to surrender his American soldiers to the British army or lead his troops into battle.<br> &nbsp;<br> Andrew left his tent and walked through the camp.<b> </b>He looked at the faces of the men who had fought beside him over the last few weeks. They were cold and hungry and tired. They had been fighting the British for weeks, even through Christmas and New Year&#x2019;s Day.<br> &nbsp;<br> To make matters worse, he and his men knew that the British army was twice the size of theirs. In every direction, the bright red coats of the British soldiers surrounded them in the woods.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> But Andrew had a plan. Even though his troops were outnumbered, they knew these woods better than the British. He knew that the British army wasn&#x2019;t expecting an early-morning attack. And he knew that he wasn&#x2019;t going to return from the war as a failure.<br> &nbsp;<br> Andrew woke his soldiers and told them to prepare for battle. As soon as it was light enough to see, General Jackson sent troops out in all directions, attacking the British from every side.<br> &nbsp;<br> The British army was taken completely by surprise. They were not prepared for this type of battle. Many British officers and their general were killed quickly, leaving the soldiers without leaders to give them orders. Andrew and his men won a major victory in just thirty minutes!<br> &nbsp;<br> The epic fight is called the Battle of New Orleans. Jackson became a national hero, and he was eventually elected the seventh president of the United States.<br> &nbsp;<br> Throughout his life, Andrew would face difficulty and danger with bravery, just as he did on that morning in 1815. His actions helped to shape a young nation as it continued to grow. A self-taught man, he gave many Americans hope that they&#x2019;d shape a better future for themselves. For this reason, Andrew Jackson became known as &#x201c;the people&#x2019;s president.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Today, however, Andrew Jackson also is remembered for some shameful events, including his terrible treatment of Native Americans and for his terrible attitudes such as his support for slavery. Jackson was a very complicated man&#x2014;stubborn, brave, quick-tempered, loyal, unforgiving&#x2014;and he has left a mixed legacy for the history books.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br><br> <b>Chapter 1:&nbsp;A Brave Boy</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Andrew Jackson was born in what was then known as the Carolinas on March 15, 1767.<br> &nbsp;<br> His parents were from Scotland. They had come to America in 1765 in search of a better life.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sailing across the Atlantic was a long and dangerous trip. It took around six weeks to cross the ocean in those days.<b> </b>Even after Andrew Sr., Elizabeth, and their two sons, Hugh and Robert, finally landed at Philadelphia, their journey was not over. They still had to travel five hundred miles by carriage to reach the home of relatives in South Carolina. The area where they lived was called the Waxhaw settlement. There wasn&#x2019;t much there at that time, and most of the settlers were poor. In addition, the land was already home to Native Americans who had lived there for generations. They did not welcome these new intruders. Violence often broke out between the local Cherokee tribe and the settlers.<br> &nbsp;<br> Andrew&#x2019;s father built a small log cabin for his growing family.<b> </b>He was a farmer who struggled to keep food on the table, and often worked seven days a week. It was a very hard life. Andrew Jackson Sr. died in the winter of 1766, shortly before Andrew was born.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now Andrew&#x2019;s mother had to struggle on by herself, with three boys and a farm to run. She was a very serious woman. She taught her sons about the importance of hard work.<br> &nbsp;<br> As a child, Andrew was smart and curious. He learned to read at an early age. Most adults back then didn&#x2019;t know how. Andrew was also full of energy. He could be wild and defiant. When he played games with his friends, he hated to lose. He often fought with other boys, even those who were bigger and stronger. Once, when he was being teased, he shouted, &#x201c;By God, if one of you laughs, I&#x2019;ll kill him!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Until Andrew was nine, South Carolina was one of thirteen colonies belonging to Great Britain. But in 1776, the colonies declared their independence. War started&#x2014;the American Revolution. The Jacksons supported the fight for independence. Andrew, still a young boy at the time, was chosen to read the Declaration of Independence out loud when a copy arrived in town. It was a great honor.<br> &nbsp;<br> Andrew&#x2019;s oldest brother, Hugh, joined the American army and was killed in battle. Andrew was very upset and angry over Hugh&#x2019;s death. He and Robert wanted to be soldiers like Hugh. They wanted to fight the British and make them pay for the death of their brother.<br> &nbsp;<br> But Andrew was only thirteen years old. When he tried to join the army, he was told that he was too young. The army made him a messenger instead. His job was to carry information back and forth between American army camps in South Carolina without the British army finding out. Andrew liked the adventure and danger, and was glad to help fight the enemy.<br> &nbsp;<br> In addition to the British, Andrew had to avoid the Cherokee Indians, who were known as fierce fighters. The Cherokees had made peace treaties and trading deals with the British, and they were not about to lose them to the new American settlers.<br> &nbsp;<br> During one battle with the British in Waxhaw, Andrew and Robert were both captured and taken to a prison in Camden, about forty miles away. The two boys were terrified.<br> &nbsp;<br> One of the British officers ordered Andrew to clean his boots. That made Andrew furious. He wasn&#x2019;t going to obey the enemy. Andrew gathered up all his courage, stood up, and refused! The soldier became so angry, he swung his sword at Andrew&#x2019;s head. The wound left a large scar that he had for the rest of his life.<br> &nbsp;<br> Andrew and Robert were thrown into prison with very little food, water, or medicine. Many prisoners caught a serious disease called smallpox, including the two boys.<br> &nbsp;<br> When the boys&#x2019; mother found out that her sons had been captured, she traveled the forty miles to the prison. Elizabeth convinced the British to include her sons in a prisoner exchange, and they were freed.<br> &nbsp;<br> Unfortunately, Robert was much sicker than Andrew. He died soon after arriving home. Andrew&#x2019;s mother also became ill and died a few months later. At only fourteen years old, Andrew was left alone.<br> &nbsp;<br> Shortly before her death, Elizabeth told Andrew, &#x201c;In this world you will have to make your own way.&#x201d;</p><h2>Human Design, Rave I&#39;Ching Card Deck (A companion to The Definitive Book of Human Design)</h2><p>Lynda Bunnell, Director of the International Human Design School, has created the first Rave I'Ching Card Deck as a companion to The Definitive Book of Human Design. This is a wonderful addition to the growing library of Human Design materials. Filled with the beautiful images of artist Kate McCavitt, there are many different ways these cards can be used to illuminate our everyday lives as we journey through this experiment to learn who we truly are. The deck can be used as an intuitive and interactive tool for learning more about the Gates and Lines of the Rave I'Ching, which are described in detail in The Definitive Book of Human Design, or to unlock our own recognitions and intuitions about ourselves and others as well. For the first time in this phase of our evolution - we have an opportunity to understand the mechanics of how life really works in these physical forms we inhabit. Human Design shows us precisely how to live as our unique authentic selves, illuminating how we can tap into our personal genetically wired authority as a guiding light for our everyday lives. And, how we can allow our personal authority to take us perfectly into our individual life purpose. &nbsp; A principal component of the system are the 64 Hexagrams of the I'Ching - which correspond to the 64 codons of our DNA - our genetic map to who we are, and how we flow with life and interact with others. As part of this new system, Ra Uru Hu, its creator, also designed a Human Design Rave I'Ching, giving us profound detail about every aspect of what it means to be human beings.</p><p></p><h2>Doc Susie: The True Story of a Country Physician in the Colorado Rockies</h2><p>Recounts how Dr. Anderson overcame tuberculosis and initial reluctance among her patients to establish a long and respected career</p><p>raphy which reads like an adventure novel."<br>BOOKWATCH<br>It is 1907 and Doc Susie came to Fraser Colorado with a bad case of tuberculosis and a broken heart. But soon she forgot about her own troubles and lived a life so colorful that Hollywood wanted to make a movie of it. For the first time, here is an account of the real Doc Susie--the amazing, inspiring story of a woman who defied her times and her fears to help those who needed her.Chapter I <i>Across the Great Divide</i><br> <p> The locomotive of Train Number One on the Denver, Northwestern and Pacific Railway steamed, hissed and clanked impatiently alongside the Moffat Station platform. Conductor George Barnes, fresh-faced and almost rakish with his bow-tie and brass buttons, stood beside the train's only passenger car stamping his feet for warmth against the frigid Denver morning. Barnes pulled his pocket watch from his vest to the length of its thick chain: 8:05, five minutes until departure - right on schedule. Although the December sunshine was bright he glanced nervously to the west. There, the Great Plains jammed to an abrupt halt against an impenetrable wall; white peaks jutted more than twice the height of mile-high Denver. Tall clouds behind the peaks could signal trouble, the possible build-up of a blizzard on the western side of the Continental divide; the pristine picture of sunshine on alpine crests could be wiped out within the two hours it would take for his train to climb to 11,660 feet, where the roadbed crossed the mountains over the highest rail line ever built in North America. Barnes didn't relish the idea of spending Christmas of 1907 marooned by avalanches, far above timberline at Corona, the "Top of the World."<br> </p><p> "All aboard . . ." he bawled, consulting his watch again.<br> </p><p> "Hold yer horses, Mr. Barnes." A baggage handler bolted from the station waiting room. "There's another passenger." <br> </p><p> "Who is he?" <br> </p><p> "Ain't a he! There's a lady in the station, feelin' poorly, so the agent is loadin' her on a trolley." <br> </p><p> Barnes' booted foot stamped an extra beat. As if he didn't have enough problems getting his outdated rolling stock over the Divide, now he had a woman to look out for - and if she was being hauled out on a baggage cart it figured that she was a lunger. In summer the Moffat Road - dubbed for its owner, David Moffat - hauled scores of tubercular "invalids" west in search of a cold, dry climate. Some found health in the lush meadows and virgin forests. The poorer ones got off the train and asked around until they found an agreeable rancher's wife who would feed hearty pot roast and venison for a small fee. Richer ones rode the train to mineral baths located at the Grand County Seat, Hot Sulphur Springs. Others got off the train in Granby and headed fifteen miles up the Colorado River to the shores of Grand Lake. The bracing mountain air seemed to make the victims feel better, but most departed when the weather started getting cold in September. According to rumor, when they returned to Eastern cities many died. </p><p> A colored porter was approaching on the platform, straining to pull a cart piled high with trunks, barrels and cartons. Perched on one side sat a delicately attractive little woman ramrod straight as though mounted sidesaddle, a small white dog cradled in her lap. Intrigued despite his annoyance, as the cart rolled to a halt Barnes hastened to assist the lady down. Lifting her by the waist he found his suspicion of fragility confirmed; beneath her voluminous petticoats she weighed very little. </p><p> Her bags were tagged for a lumber camp named Fraser, in Grand County about 85 miles across the Continental Divide from Denver. From October until June the railroad was the only means of getting there. Berthoud Pass, the wagon road between Denver and the area called Middle Park, was blockaded during the long winters by deep snows. Until tracks had been laid over the front range three years previously, there had been no winter route to pierce the area's splendid isolation. Although less than 50 miles from Denver "as the crow flies," people joked that no sensible crow would ever attempt to wing it over 13,000-foot peaks, even in summer. </p><p> "Ma'am, are you sure you want to go to Fraser? Nothin' there but a sawmill and a few shacks. And it's so cold they say you've got to get out of town to get warm."<br> </p><p> "I know Fraser," the woman replied. Her voice was low and pleasant. </p><p> "I've been there." <br> </p><p> "This is a dangerous trip in winter even for men. Avalanches can leave you stranded for weeks. Why don't you wait until July or August. Can't beat summertime in the high country." <br> </p><p> "Because the Continental Divide won't go away, no matter when I travel. And you're going there with or without me, so it may as well be with me."<br> </p><p> "What's the hitch?" A short stocky man with a bushy beard was leaning out from the vestibule of the passenger car. His eyes met Barnes's and rolled in dismay as the two watched the diminutive stranger dictate to the baggage handlers exactly how they should stack her belongings alongside mail bags. To an offer to tie her dog next to her luggage she said, "Of course not," and that was that. </p><p> Covertly, Barnes studied the woman. High cheekbones gave her face distinction. Her delicate nostrils were set over full lips that drooped in a perpetual pout. Dark eyebrows arched perfectly over piercing blue eyes fringed with long lashes. Only the deep, lavender circles showing through the transparent skin beneath her eyes contradicted the suggestion of buoyant youth. Barnes took her for thirty-odd; actually she was thirty-seven. </p><p> Her clothing was well-cut, from fur hat and woolen coat to expensive, but sensible, boots. She certainly didn't look like one of the homely mail order brides who showed up from time to time. And she definitely was too refined to be a soiled dove headed for a logging camp like Arrow or Fraser to open her own crib to service lumberjacks. If somebody had expected a relative from the East, he probably would have heard about it. Whoever she was, he heartily wished she would stay in Denver and wrap Christmas presents. </p><p> As he assisted the woman aboard, her dog growled and pawed at him. "Careful," she said matter-of-factly. "He will bite."</p></p><h2>The Optimist&#39;s Daughter</h2><p>A war widow who has returned to the South finally understanding her past, her parents, her marriage and herself</p><p></p><h2>Becoming a Leader: Everyone Can Do It</h2><p>&#34;Explains how every person is created to be a leader in his or her own sphere of influence and describes the process of developing one&#39;s leadership potential&#34;--Provided by publisher.</p><p></p><h2>Writing Grammar 10 Student Txt</h2><p>Writing and Grammar 10 Student Worktext, 4th ed., provides systematic grammar and usage instruction with ample practice activities for students.
